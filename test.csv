1,"It doesn't matter that it isn't hard to remember. Fractions aren't that complicated, you're right. The point everyone is trying to make here is that fractions are unnecessarily harder than using the metric system for this.

Metric wrenches and drill bits and stuff all just go in millimeters, with each 1 mm bigger in size than the previous one. You only need to be able to count, which is undeniably easier than fractions."
2,I find it funny that this is downvoted
3,"They are really getting ridicoulous with all the timegating. Flying, bullshit Suramar useless quests, letting you catch up with alts and then just lock them out behind repetitive awful grinds the next patch etc etc.

Flying was one of the key selling points for their first expansion, now they making you wait half an expansion and then spend countless hours on unlocking  something that should be pretty much given. Make you spend time on something you earned a long time ago basically."

20,"I actually disagree, in that I think the system which made Bojo PM, although flawed is better than the alternative and I agree with the idea that a political party forms a government and elects a PM rather than the people.

It gives parties the ability to recall PMs rather than have to commit. Reducing the negative effects of partisanship.

and realistically, I think Bojo would have won an election.

26,"&gt; 88 means Heil Hitler, who once you hear the non-Jewish POV on him, you will see was a good dude. 

What?

Even if you don't believe the 6 million Jews claim (I don't), Hitler murdered *many* millions of innocent civilians in concentration camps, including Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Poles, Russians, and the disabled. He also invaded Russia, which led to over ten million dead just on the eastern front. 

And what *good* did Hitler do? He said mean things about the banksters? He was put into power by those same banksters and industrialists, and he started disastrous wars that Germany could never win, which completely destroyed the country and killed tens of millions of people."

You just have to look to all the problems in the US with voting machines to say stick to paper ballots.
36,"Yeah, it's a different set of skills to minimize losses in a losing matchup vs. maximize a lead in a winning matchup. Sneaky and Zeyzal are great at the first one, but they might not be quite as good at the second one, so maybe that's why they are often put in a losing matchup so that top or mid can get a winning matchup, as Licorice and Nisqy are better able to take advantage of those."

47,That camera angle looks so much better here. In Germany we have a totally reversed angle for some reason.
48,"The damage from EMP doesn't affect Sombra since she has no shield hp (unless affected by Sound Barrier; I'm honestly not sure how the interaction between EMP onto a Sombra with Stealth + SB hp works, but my *guess* is that it would break Stealth).

Hack itself does no damage, so it can't disable Stealth by doing damage. It also doesn't cause Sombra to automatically attack someone, which means that Stealth isn't broken for that reason. Stealth also isn't a passive, so none of the passive rules come into play, and the button gets disabled as normal, meaning no Hack rule is violated there.

That leaves the question about whether it is a voluntary infinite transformation that should operate under the ""Revert to default"" rule like other such abilities. The other abilities we have in that category are Sprint, Roll, and Configuration: Sentry. However, unlike Stealth, none of those abilities have a cooldown (Stealth has a 6 s cooldown) and none of them are interrupted by taking damage (even a fraction of a point of damage is enough to break Stealth), so they obviously operate under other rules and have some strengths that Stealth doesn't (but have the weakness of not being Hack-proof).

With Stealth having different rules in some regards (and thus having its own weaknesses), the question boils down to ""Should *the hack effect* from Hack/EMP cancel Stealth?"", which is a question of how Sombra vs. Sombra should play out. That's a messy matter to consider, since just how well a hero counters itself isn't something that's consistent across the board (e.g. running Widow to counter Widow is rather good (provided you're not running a significantly worse Widow, of course), running Pharah to counter Pharah is rather less so), making a hero better against itself isn't necessarily a good thing since that makes it more likely that people will run mirror comps (which isn't good for a varied meta), and as with other possible changes (e.g. being able to override Hacked healthpacks or seeing through Stealth with Opportunist if the other Sombra is at less than 50 %  hp) there likely are different opinions about whether it actually would make the Sombra vs. Sombra matchup better if it worked differently."

55,"I'm asking for your information. You blew it off. I called you out. 

The only difference is that you have literally no proof that it happened. Just some stretched logic and a desperation to be correct. The evidence that it happened is overwhelming. But any presented is just blown off as doctored. This is why it's impossible to convince you of anything. You would rather dig yourself into the sand than concede a point.

You would rather assert everything that doesn't agree with you as fake than be truly challenged on your position. Anyone who debates with you, you mock. You're intellectually dishonest."

85,"Not entirely.  I am rejecting it insofar as people choose to have a higher cost of living.  Circumstances that are beyond a person's control or would be unreasonable to change are different.

For example, if I told you that there was a person who purchased a very large home, with a swimming pool and hot tub, hired a cleaning service, and so on, and as a consequence was living paycheque to paycheque or even severely in debt, would you accept that they were poor?  Or would you say that they were just choosing to spend all their money?  At some point it's not cost of living, it's a choice.  And that's a real example by the way."

&amp;#x200B;

Nana is definately not taking all this well. Too afraid to face Hachi, she waited so lang that Hachi moved out in the meantime; and having drowned her phone, She is likely unable to contact Hachi ...allthough that phone does kinda look like one of those indestructable Nokia ones...

&amp;#x200B;

Keeping Shin out of the loop didn't help anybody either, he's now just going to pester around wondering what on earth happened, making uncalled for comments due to not knowing any better, which is also definately not good for Nana's state of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

The paparazzi might turn out to be a double-edged sword. If that story with Nana breaks, Gaia might be more willing to sign Blast, because the've got a known member. However that way of getting fame is percissely not what Nana's pride wants, and it would likely prevent her from ever gaining appreciation as a singer without being marked as ""Ren's Girl"".

&amp;#x200B;

As for Hachi moving out ...she did at one point say that she wanted a big house. I feel like she also is not really willing to stay around Nana right now, however."

104,"There was,  many Ska bands were socialist leaning
 A. K.

You also had singers like Billy Brag whose songs were and still are socialist politically.

But Poch came in to take a team that had no such aspirations and build them up in a way that they can afford to have the same dreams as City and Liverpool today, which is obviously impressive to a coach who similarly took Watford from being relegation favorites to a side that could dream about upper mid table."

I on the other side am very neutral about Messi and Ronaldo, I convinced her to watch all the Real Madrid games in Champions League with me during the Zidane era. I still vividly remember her dying a little bit inside everytime she saw Ronaldo scores a goal and try to find excuses to deny his greatness. I can tell she gradually started to feel guilty/ashamed if she goes against herself and admit Ronaldo is great so she remained stubborn and disapprove of Ronaldo as long as she can. But surely after the 3 CL winnings, the Euro 2016, balloon dior winner, I think she must have enough. One day, out of the blue, she suddenly confess to me: she has been following Ronaldo Instagram for a while and she admit she started to become a big fan of Ronaldo.

A few months before a more popular girl died of toxic shock syndrome related sepsis from leaving a tampon in for over a month or something. 

The school had a lot of grief counseling for the girl and addressed it. My friend was from Mexico and was apart of our weird gothy group so there was no mention of it even with the lock in, us goth/emo kids probably could have really used the grief counseling. The fall out from his loss was alcoholism, suicide attempts and heavy drug use. My friends completely changed, most were poor and couldn't afford therapy. I was already in therapy and living in a traumatic situation. Watching the slow decline in all those lives was still heartbreaking. 

It's crazy how popularity even affects death in high school."

278,"&gt;Guaido is recognized as president by parliament. Maduro is an evil dictator.

1. Venezuela is a presidential republic, not a semi-presidential nor a parliamentarian republic. Nobody gives a rat's ass about what the parliament thinks about who is president. The Congress in the USA is held by Democrats who want to get Trump impeached, that doesn't make Nancy Pelosi president, you can't just appoint yourself as head of state willy-nilly.

2. The parliament is below the constituent assembly, which favours the PSUV.

3. Maduro isn't a dictator when he is [democratically elected](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/venezuela-president-maduro-illegitimate-10-facts-counter-lies) and *actually let's someone committing high treason on a daily basis to roam around free*. In the Netherlands Guaido would have already been arrested for trying to overthrow the government.

&gt;All pro-democracy countries are lining up behind Guaido. All anti-democracy countries are supporting Maduro.

What type of infantile ""good guys vs bad guys"" worldview is that? Yes, most Western countries are imperialist powers aligned with the US somewhat. Do you think someone like Bolsonaro, an admirer of the military dictatorship in Brazil, is ""pro-democracy""? Are people like Elliot Abrams who supplied fascist rebels in Nicaragua and betrayed their own country in the Iran-Contra-Affair ""pro-democracy""?"

293,"I personally think you are naive if you would trust a different Inspector General after one of them had already proven to be ineffective because of our broken classification of information system. If he went to *any* Inspector General, they would ask the NSA to confirm the information is valid, and the NSA would claim that they could neither confirm nor deny the information as it is a matter of national security. That would be the end of that.

I personally believe he did the right thing. He gave the government forewarning that the information was going to be released, and then he let the American people know, so it couldn't be covered up. He *is* a hero, and he is stuck in Russia because the US government is trying to make an example out of him. That's why they charged him with a crime that is strict liability. It ensures that a jury cannot take into account whether him leaking the information was a just action, only whether he  did leak information. Since he obviously did, if he returns to the US he will be found guilty and spend the rest of his life in a concrete box in ADX Florence, or whatever off-the-record gulag they throw him in."

Included in those 593,775 possible compositions are:

- 8,008 compositions with six DPS
- 61,152 compositions with five DPS
- 165,620 compositions with four DPS
- 35,280 compositions with three DPS and a single off tank

Assuming I did my math right, that's a little more than a third of those possible compositions that instantly turn off a lot of players. The pro-lock position is essentially one of quality over quantity when it comes to team compositions."

Disney doesn't rip-off anyone that isn't DreamWorks (&amp; vice versa tbf). There are also key differences in the properties, like Simba not wearing Mufasa's skin like Kimba, the absence of humans in the Lion King, animals being biologically as strong as they are in the real world, as opposed to Kimba, where the titular lion is strong enough to halt a stampeding elephent, etc. It's not so black &amp; white as you seem to think it is."

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

&gt; Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 - September 7, 2003) was an American rock singer-songwriter and musician noted for including his unique and sometimes sardonic opinions of life in his musical lyrics, composing songs that were sometimes humorous and often had political or historical themes.

&gt; Zevon's work has often been praised by well-known musicians, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His best-known compositions include ""Werewolves of London"", ""Lawyers, Guns and Money"", ""Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner"" and ""Johnny Strikes Up The Band,"" all of which are featured on his third album, Excitable Boy (1978). Other well-known songs written by Zevon have been recorded by other artists, including ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me"" (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), ""Accidentally Like a Martyr,"" ""Mohammed's Radio"", ""Carmelita"", and ""Hasten Down the Wind"".

&gt; Along with his own compositions, Zevon recorded or performed occasional covers, including Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" and Leonard Cohen's ""First We Take Manhattan"". He was a frequent guest on Late Night with David Letterman and the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman later performed guest vocals on ""Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)"" with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.

&gt; He was born to a Russian Jewish father and a Mormon mother and soon moved to California. At the age of 12/13, Warren Zevon was a regular visitor to the home of Igor Stravinsky where he, along with Robert Craft, would study music.

&gt; He turned to a musical career early, including a stretch as part of a Sonny and Cher-type male/female duo called Lyme and Cybelle, and spent time as a session musician (notably as piano player for the Everly Brothers) and jingle composer. He wrote several songs for his White Whale label-mates the Turtles, though his participation in their recording is unknown. Another early composition (""She Quit Me"") was included in the soundtrack for Midnight Cowboy, released in 1969. His first attempt at a solo album, Wanted Dead or Alive (1969), did not fare well, and his second effort, Leaf in the Wind, was scrapped (though release was considered just prior to his death). In the early 70s he toured regularly with the Everly Brothers as keyboard player and band leader/musical coordinator. His dissatisfaction with his career and the opportunities for a song-writer led him to move to Spain briefly, where he played in a small bar owned by a former mercenary. Together, they penned Zevon's classic ""Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner.""

&gt; In the mid-70s he moved to Los Angeles, and became associated with the then-burgeoning West coast music scene, including collaborations with Jackson Browne, who would produce and promote Zevon's self-titled major-label debut in 1976, The Eagles, who appeared on that first album, and Linda Ronstadt, who would record several early Zevon songs including a hit version of ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me"". Zevon's first tour in 1977 included guest appearances in the middle of Jackson Browne concerts.

&gt; In 1978 Zevon released his breakthrough album, Excitable Boy, to critical acclaim and popular success. Several tracks from this album received heavy FM airplay and the single release ""Werewolves of London"", which featured a relatively lighthearted version of Zevon's signature macabre outlook, was a top-ten hit.

&gt; For the next 20 years Zevon would continue to record and release albums sporadically and with varying levels of success, while fighting personal demons including an acknowledged battle with alcoholism and drugs. (His fourth album, Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School is dedicated to novelist Ross Macdonald, who crucially assisted Zevon during a particularly difficult episode in 1979.) Apparently success did not treat Zevon well, as evidenced by his movements (living on Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square, etc.), well-documented stints in rehab, and withdrawal from the spotlight. After the release of The Envoy in 1982, Zevon effectively quit his career as a full-time occupation, appearing rarely and usually solo, without a band. He also collaborated with several members of R.E.M. to record as the Hindu Love Gods in 1990, though initial collaboration occurred during his ""lost period"" in 1984.

&gt; In 1987 Zevon made a comeback with a modest hit album Sentimental Hygiene, which featured collaborations with Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and members of R.E.M., among others including long-time collaborators Jorge Calderone and Waddy Wachtel. The follow-up album, Transverse City in 1989 also featured guests, including Jerry Garcia and David Gilmour. The tradition of collaborations with more famous musical talents was consistent throughout his career, from the appearance of Jackson Browne and The Eagles on his first album, to Bruce Springsteen on his last.

&gt; Zevon toured the US regularly during the 90s, often alone, with minimal accompaniment. He did conduct a tour with Odds, a band from Vancouver, Canada. Many tours started in Colorado to allow Warren an opportunity to visit with his long-time friend, Hunter S. Thompson. Warren was close to several prominent writers who also collaborated on song-writing, including Carl Hiassen. He also served as musical coordinator for an ad-hoc group called the Rock Bottom Remainders, a collection of writers performing rock and roll standards at book fairs and other events. This group included Stephen King, Dave Barry, and other popular writers.

&gt; In interviews, Zevon described a lifelong phobia of doctors and seldom received medical assessment. In 2002, after a long period of untreated illness and pain, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a doctor; when he did so he was diagnosed with inoperable mesothelioma (a form of lung cancer associated with exposure to asbestos rather than smoking). He then began recording his final album, The Wind, with guest appearances from close friends including Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty and others.

&gt; On October 30, 2002, Zevon was featured on the Late Show with David Letterman as the only guest for the entire hour. Zevon performed several songs and spoke at length about his illness. Zevon was a frequent guest and occasional substitute bandleader on Letterman's television shows since Late Night first aired in 1982. It was this show where Zevon offered his insight on facing death: ""enjoy every sandwich.""

&gt; Zevon previously stated that his illness was expected to be terminal within months after the diagnosis in the Fall of 2002; however he lived to see the birth of twin grandsons in June of 2003 and the release of The Wind on August 28, 2003. When his diagnosis became public, he told the media that he just hoped to live long enough to see the next James Bond movie, a goal he also accomplished. Appropriately, the film was called Die Another Day.

&gt; Zevon died at his home in Los Angeles, California, on September 7, 2003. The Wind was certified gold by the RIAA in December of 2003 and Zevon received 5 posthumous Grammy nominations, including Song Of The Year for ""Keep Me In Your Heart"".

&gt; A tribute album titled Enjoy Every Sandwich: Songs of Warren Zevon was released October 19, 2004. His son, Jordan Zevon, did a large part of the work on the album and performed ""Studebaker,"" a previously unreleased composition. A second tribute album, titled Hurry Home Early: the Songs of Warren Zevon (the lyrics ""hurry home early"" are from the song ""Boom Boom Mancini,"" on Sentimental Hygiene) was released by Wampus Multimedia on July 8, 2005.

&gt; On February 14, 2006, VH1 Classic premiered a video from a new compilation, ""Reconsider Me: The Love Songs of Warren Zevon."" The video, titled ""She's Too Good For Me,"" aired every hour on the hour throughout the day. The video was not well received among many of Zevon's fans, as evidenced by their responses on the official Bulletin Board. Read more on Last.fm.

425,"Does the guys running Winnipeg even want to start on transit system? Why nothing was even started 50 years ago?

Ok, so far I see, Winnipeg has yet to reach a population of 1 million and the suburban around doesn't really exists...

Does Winnipeg is constantly grid lock and bus can't even move around? Did Winnipeg even attempted any investment for alternative such as providing bike sharing?

Such project could be terribly expensive to even maintain... this could trigger a rise of taxes which could kill some business there. Does the population is even ok with that?

Environment wise, does the aboriginal population want to keep urbanizing the place?

Did the conservative even hinted any political will to start up something there? Does the municipality even want a MRT ?

My guess is, if Winnipeg elected a ""young"" conservative lawyer as mayor([in the office for about 5 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Bowman_\(politician\))), not sure this would the right kind of guy you can expect to start spending on infrastructure like crazy and creating massive debt for the city/province."

434,"*Chungking Express*

After watching *In the Mood for Love* a few months ago, I knew immediately that Wong Kar-wai would be one of those few directors for whom I would seek out all of their movies. Although it took a while to get to movie number two, I’m very glad I did. For those who don’t know, *Chungking Express* follows two policemen in Hong Kong who each fall for a woman — the first with a mysterious drug smuggler and the other with a quirky weirdo who works at a fast food stand.

Just like *In the Mood for Love*, the actual substance of the story plays second fiddle to the *way* the story is told. Highly stylized and with voiceover narration at parts, the movie may not be for everyone, but those who can buy into the “style over substance” approach are sure to love it.

The only real gripe I have with the film is that the two stories told, while similar in theme, aren’t connected in many ways. This wouldn’t be too much of a problem on its own except for the fact that there is quite a gap in quality between the first half and second half of the movie, with the second half being far superior, in my opinion. Don’t get me wrong — the first half is still great, but the second half is the *Chungking Express* people always rave about. It’s the half of the film with “California Dreamin’” playing all the time, the neat cleaning montage set to Faye Wong’s cover of “Dreams,” and the two immaculate shots that are pretty difficult to explain.

Overall, the movie is fantastic (and surprisingly funny), and if you like movies with a lot of style and/or like the melancholic small-person-in-a-big-city feel of a movie like *Lost in Translation*, then this one is a must-see. **9/10**"

I’ve read so far into her history and seen that before she met him, she was a much more lively and happier person. She had some habits like cocaine and mdma, along with drinking but honestly, me and more than half my mates went through that phase too. 

Blake was the typical heroin-rocker. He introduced her to that, and enabled it 100%.

509,"The Night King was very very close to winning, which is why I am amazed that so many people act like he was ""defeated easily"". He brought a storm to lower visibility for the dragons. He calculated bringing back the dead at the right point in the battle to reinforce his forces. But his one mistake was underestimating Bran/3ER, who already knew what the Night King was going to do and where he was going to be. Bran also knew Arya would be ideal for killing the Night King with her training, giving her the dagger. It's these subtle things that show it wasn't ""easy"" to do what Bran and Arya did, they just had become collectively stronger than the Night King imagined."

In my personal opinion, this will depend on a very particular factor.

RUSSIA. 

&amp;#x200B;

The parallels were all there.

&amp;#x200B;

On one end, we had Gorbachev bringing ""democracy"" to Russia. On other end, Li Peng flatten it to maintain ""law on order"".

&amp;#x200B;

 One country quickly slide into economic collapse, other became an economic superpower.

&amp;#x200B;

 Today one have elections, while other have leaders selected by the party. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Russia eventually become an better country then China, then Gorbachev's vision was correct. Otherwise, Li Peng will be vindicated by history.

808,"There’s two reasons for this. One, league is a team based game - where individual prowess is hardly ever displayed internationally. Historically na has been so far behind in macro play as a team, that individual players were never able to shine. Second, (and kinda similar to the first) NA isn’t the top region in the world rn so people won’t say their individual players are also the top players. Remember 2014-2017 when all the top 20 players were basically only Koreans with one or two western players thrown in? And if someone suggested a western player they’d get crucified? Well, now the top 20 players would be Eu and China players because they’re the best regions. Before FNC made finals last year, i bet you no one would have put a single FNC player top 10, and it’d be arguable for top 20 - probably caps. Now, caps would be a top 5 player on most people’s lists because EU as a region is having lots of success. The same thing happens regionally too, the all star players at the end of every season are generally filled up with players of the top 3 teams because people have no idea how to differentiate individual skill from team success, because league is so team play based"

854,"&gt;Yeah, but it will never be a 100% change. Your bone structure, height, etc will never be able to change as that of a natural born.

Genes expressed can be altered through hormone therapy. So if a trans person gets hormones early enough (as many anti-trans groups are trying to prevent), their bone structure, lungs, height etc. will be identical to a cis person of the same gender.

&gt;I don't know what the current science says about which gender has an advantage on average, but it's 100% true that personality has a big effect on sports. Maybe there is, maybe there isn;t.

If you are talking about personality types then yes they perform differently in situations. If anything, in that case, Trans people are at a disadvantage.

872,"Really glad you're picking up on a bit of Anthy-Utena relationship, even if it is just a comedy episode. I always thought Anthy was a bit standoffish in these episodes, but to be honest I'm seeing now that Utena might care about Anthys freedoms as an individual but she never asks Anthy any questions about herself besides friends, until the info gets thrust into her face. It doesn't really seem like a close relationship further than roommates."

875,"Free for all as far as helmets are concerned maybe, but there are plenty of laws that govern cyclists. Look through the link I posted, the laws are actually pretty good, it's just that they rarely get enforced. 

For example, the law says that if there's a dedicated bike path next to (or near)  a road, cyclists must use it, but I regularly see cyclists in Montreal ignoring the bike path because riders there are too slow for them and the cops seeing them don't do anything about it. I also regularly see cyclist blow through busy pedestrian crossings in summer with no consequences. People have actually been injured by cyclists doing this, and the municipal government doesn't seem to care. 

In the end, it's all political. The cyclists successfully insinuated themselves into the environmentalist lobby, so any time a politician tries to be critical on them, they get accused of being anti-environment."

901,"I am all for further investigation of anyone, explicitly including Chandler, Clinton and Trump, with suspicious connections to Epstein.

I am adamantly opposed, however, to any self-appointed sleuthing that involves evidence based on “symbology.”  More often than not, its the perfect recipe for bumblefuck pareidolia and “satanic panic.” It is also, minor technicality here, not illegal.

It could also be used to convict literally anyone on this board. So, you go to internet boards focused on nasty subjects to do with kids, do you? Is this an “interest” of yours? Wait, didn’t  this whole discussion start of 4chan, a site with so much sexual ones images of kids that they invented the pedobear mascot as a joke?  You ever play any video games that involve simulated murder? These people are sick. Listen why don’t you have a seat over there?

Bam, you are now one of the evildoers.

By all means, use network analysis and actual forensics and network analysis to connect Chandler to Epstein and Clinton. Establish evidence of any actual LEGAL VIOLATIONS. But the conclusion that everyone who ever had a black eye is a satanist murderer is lazy and sloppy investigative work.

REAL evidence only, please."

968,I've been trying to figure this one out  for a while as well. I'm pretty open minded when it comes to music and I listen to a variety of genres but I cannot find anything appealing at all about her. Very mediocre lyrics. Vocals always sound like they're barely above a whisper. I mean I guess for someone so young it's impressive that she has such a following but the fact that she has blown up so big over the past year and is already getting headlining slots at major music festivals is mind boggling to me.
969,"Weird... I grew up in Madoc and then lived ~10 minutes outside of Belleville for the last half of highschool so I graduated from CSS lol. Then I lived in Kingston for ~6 years, Toronto for a couple, and now I'm back near Frankford. Small world :P

Tbf... by some unknown miracle, Trenton is actually nicer than Belleville now. Feels wrong to say... but Belleville turned into a shithole while Trenton managed to turn around after years of being a shithole lol. But ya... rent in Belleville is ridiculous at this point given the economy is still stagnant and nobody can afford the rents being charged. Meanwhile all new builds are massive houses, overpriced townhouses, or overpriced condos that nobody around here can afford. 

I'm actually expecting to ""come into some money"" in a few years from some investments I expect to do well. My plan is to use that money to buy as many rental properties in Belleville and the surrounding areas as I can so I can a) retire early from rental income, but more importantly b) keep rental properties locally owned and act as my own form of rent control with prices that are pegged lower than the average rent price. I spend an inordinate amount of time complaining about our affordable housing crisis and how we've done next to nothing to address it, so my goal is to take whatever money I manage to make and put it where my mouth is to try to provide shelters people can actually afford. Sadly even if it plays out as I hope, it'll still amount to a drop in the bucket."

Really though these list mean nothing, just because a team is doing well domestically doesn't make them a good team. NA teams always have hype over dominating their region then go limp at worlds/MSI.

Kelsey did point out that's just a mechanical mistake, but then they just brushed off the example when Loco admitted he didn't watch the games. I don't think flaming loco is the way to go honestly, rather, we should encourage loco and the guests to engage in these points BETTER without necessarily making the show dry and boring because they go over a lv3 gank for an hour and a half.

Thorin even wants to keep the discussion relatively high-level b/c he knows loco has less knowledge than kelsey, but even then, you can use evidence to support your points like... yknow..... our entire due process, legal system, scientific method, etc etc etc is based off of.

1070,Serfdom had been abolished in France by 16th century and by 1789 French peasants were relatively well off and most of them owned their own land. The revolution wasn't even started by the peasants but by the urban poor in Paris who were much more sensitive to rising of bread prices than people in the countryside since they had to buy their flour or bread. Peasants will start a major counter revolution few years after the original revolution.
1071,"EDC Las Vegas is probably the most renowned and largest EDM festival on the planet. Sure, Tomorrowland for example is a little more grandiose when it comes to stage designs and atmosphere, but the big EDC every year in Las Vegas is on another level in terms of scale. 

One year when we went, the headliner stage alone named Kinetic Field I think held 80,000 people on one corner of the speedway. There were I think 6 other stages that year *besides* that. 

I can't actually *describe* how EDC is to people. The best I can do is just show them a youtube video [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV7sq0rO0BU) but even that can't do it justice. EDC is a magical experience. Some people have even called it life-changing. So when you watch the video in the link I posted here, and see what type of music and experience it is, you can begin to imagine how obnoxious and shitty someone like DJ Khaled is at it. I don't understand how he managed to get onto an event, let alone be given a big AAA stage like he was. I imagine Pasquale (the event promoter and owner of the EDC brand) had a friend who told him it would be a good idea.

1088,"I'm totally with you about Brexiteers i.e. the lifelong eurosceptics that plague the Tory party since Thatcher. I don't think most of the people who voted for brexit were long standing eurosceptics. They were people sick of seeing their local services run down by austerity, sick of seeing the armed services become a shadow of their notions of what a GB military should look like, sick of the NHS crumbling, sick of jobs becoming zero hour contracts without dignity. And then someone came along with a bus and they hopped on, because they had nothing else to lose. They were last minute eurosceptics and happy to kick the euro loving ""elite"" in the nuts because they were sick of being ignored in their own country. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for life long eurosceptics, sure they didn't like a lot of what went through under Blair. But that was just Blairs luck to be pm at the time of lisbon. No previous british pm offered a referendum on any EU treaty in the UK. Major had the same problem when he signed the UK up to Maastricht in 1992. Can everything be pinpointed to him too by your logic? Sure he didn't exercise the option to restrict the eastern european migration for a few years, but it would have happened in any case. And yes, there's no turning backward in European unity. It is a ratchet. But that's the terms of the project that have been in treaties since Rome. It wasn't anything new in recent years, so I don't count it as a reason."

1091,"If you are talking specifically about Ontario we have an energy surplus much of which gets exported to the US. The same is true for BC and Quebec also. Ontario have 8.36 million light vehicles. If we assume that the average driver in Ontario does 20,000 kms a year then if every light vehicle was converted to an EV and we assume an efficiency of 6 kms per kWh then you would need 27.87 TwH a year to charge them all. Ontario exported 18.6 TwHs of electricity last year. So that alone would be enough to charge a big chunk of them. Also most EVs will charge in the middle of the night when there is the most excess capacity in the grid.  A grid isn't normally running at full capacity all the time.  It needs afar less in the middle of the night then in the middle of the day.   Last night at 3am Ontario needed 12,500 MWs of power online to satisfy demand.    There is actually 36,989 MWs of generating capacity available.   So there is plenty of extra generation especially if you get people to charge when you want.   If it ever becomes an issue Ontario already has time of use rates.   You just create an extra low TOU rate for EVs between 1am-5am to get people to charge then.   So it is doubtful in the current environment that much new generation capacity would need to be brought online to satisfy demand.  WE would just need to use what we have more optimally."

We've got two class left backs, which is the most Scottish thing ever. How many of these players barring Andrew Robertson and the Celtic boys have played a massive European game?  


I don't blame the players for going to the Championship or even the MLS, but in the grand scheme of things - you're playing against mediocre shite in these leagues every few matches. Not to say the Russians are playing in Europe's elite but I'd probably heard of more Russians playing tonight than Scottish players. (Might be a wee stretch there)  


Get the 30-somethings out of the squad, thank them for their service to the country and blood in the new generation. San Marino is the perfect place to start, give them a winning start at home - it's the Nations League Playoffs or bust, we've played Belgium and Russia twice and got Cyprus, Kazakhstan and San Marino to finish. Let the youngsters play and see what's out there. Somewhat counter intuitive I understand that I want Clarke to play players that I'd never heard of but we need to find a squad that works."

Instead of ‘everyone doesn’t have an excuse to not eat meat.’ It should be ‘let’s make alternatives cheaper and more accessible.’ But it ties into other things like cost of living and population and stuff, like how eating meat wasn’t a terrible thing until it became a complete industrial/capitalist thing.

1209,"&gt;Hundredths and Thousandths of inches are used all the time at a small scale. Even SAE die hards don't want to be measuring something in terms like 7/4096.

Yes, but that's exactly what I'm talking about. This is part of why the metric system was introduced in the first place, because you can just do this at all size scales. Because now you can call your thousandth of an inch a milli-inch and keep working in that scale. And you can call your throusand inches a kilo-inch all your rules apply again.

The way it's now, you can only really do this with the inch and the ""milli-inch"", but as you go to bigger scales, you will have to convert to feet and yards and miles with weird conversion rates. That's why you can't just tell someone you have 40,000 inches and he'll know how many yards those are.

And you can also not measure anything in the nano-inch scale unless everyone agrees that from inch downward you'll now use only the inch as the base unit.

&amp;#x200B;

The decimal point for units that are not based on base-10 is only useful within your one unit because conversion to the next bigger or smaller unit is horrible.

But I think it's important, for the sake of people who do have more severe issues, not to make the claims like ""you don't know what sadness is before you are severely depressed"". A lot of people have difficulties with aggression and/or sadness without being in a more severe state, and I think the OP makes a helpful reminder. It's important to remember that severe difficulties are outliers (and no, this does not mean they are abnormal), and not everyone who tilts regularly in online games have the kind of difficulty you are talking about. There are just normal cases of people tilting regularly. and these people, too, deserve attention."

The fact that you're OK with private ownership of nuclear weapons lays bare the lack of rational thought with your stance. They have the potential to wipe out millions of people at a time.

Multicultural intermingling is absolutely essential, except with straight white men.  Borders are imaginary and immigration law is meaningless.  Nothing is more important than unseating the white male patriarchy, even if it means watering down the evolutionary traits that made humans successful in the first place.  Humans are allowed to identify as absolutely whatever they want in order to be happy no matter how deranged and depraved it might be, so long as it rejects male heterosexuality it's absolutely correct and questioning it makes you a bigot.  Questioning anything at all about this official narrative, in fact, makes you a bigot, a racist, a misogynist, indeed whatever buzzword that can be slipped in depending on the details of the micro-aggressive oppression you're oozing if you're a straight white male.

&amp;#x200B;

Raven wargs into him . Proven wrong when the old 3ER says ""it's time for you to become me"". Doesn't warg into him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Raven never sees the future. The old 3ER clearly saw the future, which is why he knew Bran was important. Bran clearly saw the future when he saw Drogon fly over King's Landing and the Throne Room in ash. Both events happened exactly as he saw. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Raven sees the past by interacting with objects and people. No, it's called Greensight and involves seeing the past through a connection to the weirwood trees. Please go read the books. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's the Raven's plan to find out Jon Snows name. Once again this makes no sense. They made it clear that the 3ER needs to know what to look for. He didn't hear the name because Lyanna whispered it. He went closer when Sam pointed him in the right direction. There's no tricking Sam, and for that to even make sense, he would need to know that Sam possessed information and needed to be tricked. Which again, would mean he doesn't need to trick Sam because he would already know it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jon's name is used as a weapon to turn Jon against Dany. Yes, for once this is correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Raven wargs into Drogon and melts the throne. No, they made clear that when an animal is warged into, their eyes go white and this does not happen. Something as big as warging into a dragon would need to be shown to the audience. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Raven probably helped the Dryads create the Night King to destroy the first men. There are no Dryads in the show. More nonsense. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 3ER can see the past and future. By seeing the past, he can quickly understand everybody's nature and history and thus manipulate them all to get what he wants. But you take it a bit too far with your nonsense that has zero clues or insight from the show."

If the study was unreliable or misleading, wouldn't it be easy to disprove? Say you're in court and you've been accused of commiting a crime; do you ignore the accusations and expect people to think you're innocent, or do you seek to disprove the accusation?

Current LE strategy is to ignore the accusations and not even address them. They're allowed to do this because they are above the law- and that's the problem.

You are an apologist for this behavior- regardless of whether or not the numbers are accurate, they have no obligation to refute them. You're an idiot for thinking the numbers aren't accurate and you're a piece of trash for thinking it's okay for them to not have to address them."

1417,"I really appreciate all the hard work you've put into your research and I believe I may be able to contribute some esoteric symbolism unto you that have been stuck in my head since a series of mushroom trips I was going on during full moon phases, okay they were full moon mushroom meditation rituals but I gained an extraordinary amount of information and insight on a cascade of subjects and data that I haven't really been able to piece together coherently like you have.

For one to bolster your theory of symbolism torwards the saturn cube, one can look to the nearly ancient universally accepted symbol of christianity it self - the cross - it is literally an unfolded cube.

For two ever since I've done this rituals I've felt a strong attraction towards Saturn, subconsciously have been becoming steadily obsessed, hell I had it as a display picture on my cellphone for months after my rituals. So it seems like my subconscious remembers my consciousness has forgotten.

For three whenever I did these rituals, time would literally freeze, things would stop, I wouldn't be able to go on the internet, or work my computer, because it wouldn't respond, it was left on before the ritual commenced and I wasn't able to turn it or the monitor off - all my clocks in the house were frozen at 12:00 for what seemed like hours. Yes I was alone when this was all happening, I could've been in an astral plane, or astrally projecting into this plane but since I was astral I was unable to actually interact with things.

So me realizing the most popular religion's symbol was an unfolded cube - my unconscious obsession with Saturn and get this - me experiencing a freezing in time - something Kronos/Saturn would be capable of doing mythologically, now me reading all these theories about Saturn's Cube, this shit is just getting weird to me now."

1463,"&gt; I mean, I honestly do see Antifa as... going about things in the wrong way sometimes

You won't find any disagreement from me or even people who participate in antifa actions on that point! While most people in support of antifa think that political violence is an option, that doesn't mean we think it should be the first or only option or that it's always justified.

&gt; while still counter-productive to the ends I think they want to achieve

While I definitely agree that sometimes their violence is counterproductive (e.g. the assault on Andy Ngo just gave him money and publicity and doesn't seem to have deterred anything), it can often be quite effective--it just doesn't tend to be particularly glamorous when it is. For example, Richard Spencer, one of the most prolific white supremacists in the US right now, no longer speaks at universities because he says antifa has ""taken all the fun out of it"", thus denying him an important way to recruit people to far-right ideologies. Ultimately, antifa isn't especially worried about optics as long as they are reducing the influence of fascism, and is usually more interested in containing the influence of fascists than it is in convincing those specific people to renounce their far-right beliefs.

In any case, no problem!"

1498,"Yes, his superior officer [Hugo Gutmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gutmann). Who was actually released and allowed to flee by SS personnel who knew his history ( Some say under direct orders from Hitler ), which is a similar story to Eduard Bloch, Hitler's childhood doctor, who also received a 'special exemption' by the Gestapo under Hitler's orders when Austria was annexed, since Hitler vowed eternal gratitude to him when he treated his mother at little to no cost.

This demonstrates how the Nazi ideology on the matter was so bankrupt that even Hitler and top-ranking Nazis themselves found occasions to essentially violate their own laws by secret orders when confronted with the feelings of dishonor and shame that might result from sending people in their own personal past that they greatly approve of to their deaths and persecution as a result of their systemic anti-Jewish policies. There were other Nazi officials doing the same thing with many mischlings particularly in the army and in their private associations, using their power to strike Jewish ancestry out of record if it was someone that they wished to preserve in a position.

All this while Goebbels is screaming into every microphone in Germany how every Jewish child is inherently parasitical, insidious and untrustworthy and therefore all Germans must do their duty in turning them over to the concentration camps and stamping out all Jewish ancestry in Europe ( and beyond ). They have no personal stake in it so they don't care, but turns out that being in the 'fond memories' of the Fuhrer or other Nazi high brass is all it takes to start deviating from the doctrine.

It was a thoroughly opportunistic, self-serving mentality. Say as many nasty things as you can possibly think of in public, kill and abuse all of those you have no sympathy for over bogus charges, but handwave away a few personal cases when it starts getting a bit too close to home, not caring that similar connections existed for all the other Jews too."
1499,"Hard locked is the keyword here, stubborn dps who lock a single dps from the beginning to the end are the problem, it can still be a problem with 2 dps but it gets worse with 3 or 4.

I know 3-4 dps teams can work, which is why I never say a word in chat about team comp until after our first few pushes, but it won't work at all if the team does not cooperate after realizing it won't work and since I mostly play solo queue at odd hours it happens a lot.

I can't wait for locked 2-2-2 ranked to be honest, it won't fix everything and dps are going to have longer queues but at least people who wants to play a single role (often dps) will be able to do so without penalizing their team.

I also flex a lot but prefer healers and will gladly dps if I have the chance, I haven't played a dps in my past 50+ games. We have to admit it, dps are way more popular than the other roles and as long as 2-2-2 is the norm and dps are more popular, it will cause issues. I wonder what the statistics are but in my whole overwatch career it only happened once that we had 3 people of the same role, other than dps, who didn't want to switch the whole game, once, and it happened a hundred times with 3+ dps."

There's too much specificity brought to the concept when it just doesn't make sense when you think about it. It would have been better if they left the details more open to interpretation."

Your statements about Baphomet here are based on modern misunderstandings. I suggest reading PD Newman's essay series ""Masonic Templary"" to gain a better understanding of the origins:

[http://www.knightstemplar.org/KnightTemplar/articles/20130209.htm](http://www.knightstemplar.org/KnightTemplar/articles/20130209.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

The modern misrepresentation of Baphoment which is largely based on people's interpretations of Eliphas Levi's illustration of the sabbatic goat does indeed have elements of duality and of course you could say any dualistic symbol could be related to any type of polarity.

I do mean Andy. He is a known instigator. Does he deserve to be attacked? Nope, but that is starkly different than a random reporter being attacked. I never said covering events is instigating violence. Andy, specifically, goes out of his way to be an instigator. Here is what I would say is a fairly balanced article about the event and some higher level topics https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/3/20677645/antifa-portland-andy-ngo-proud-boys . It goes over some of what Andy does that goes beyond journalism. And again, I am not saying he ""deserved it"". I am saying it was not random, and it was not merely because he was a journalist.

&gt;I am not saying that Right-Wing Violence isn't a thing...

Yeah, bro, that's what you did when you said there aren't right wing attacks. What do you think shooting at protestors, setting up sniper nests, beating black people, running people over, killing your liberal father, etc are? They are attacks against people for having different opinions than you.

I wrote you off as an idiot the moment you said there aren't right wing attacks. It had nothing to do with what political party you claim to support. It has to do with you ducking out of objective reality."

&gt; The Cure are a rock band which formed in 1976 in Crawley, England, United Kingdom. The band originally consisted of Robert Smith (vocals, guitar), Porl Thompson (guitar), Michael Dempsey (bass) and Lol Tolhurst (drums), with the band's lineup overgoing several changes throughout the years and Smith remaining as the only constant member throughout the band's history. The band currently consists of Smith (vocals, guitar), Simon Gallup (bass), Roger O'Donnell (keyboards), Jason Cooper (drums) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar). The Cure has released 13 studio albums and have sold 27 million albums worldwide and are considered a major influence on alternative rock, goth rock and new wave music. 

&gt; The Cure's full lineup history is as follows: Robert Smith (vocals, guitar 1976-present), Lol Tolhurst (drums, keyboards 1976-1989), Michael Dempsey (bass 1976-1979), Porl Thompson (guitar, keyboards 1976-1978, 1983-1992, 2005 -2010), Simon Gallup (bass, keyboards 1979-1982, 1985-present), Matthieu Hartley (keyboards 1979 -1980), Andy Anderson (drums 1983-1984), Phil Thornalley (bass 1983-1984), Boris Williams (drums 1984-1994), Roger O'Donnell (keyboards 1987 -1990, 1995-2005, 2011-present), Perry Bamonte (guitar, keyboards 1990-2005), Jason Cooper drums 1995-present) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar 2012-present)

&gt; Just as the group's lineup has changed, the band's sound has evolved throughout the years, starting off as a post-punk band similar to Wire and Gang of Four before morphing into a gothic rock band in the early 80's, to a synthpop group in the mid-80's and a power-pop-alternative band in the early 90's. The Cure has always been an alternative and very independent band which was evident from the early days. Shunning the anarchistic tendencies of many punk bands after their formation in 1976 , The Cure's first release was Killing an Arab, based on material from French writer Albert Camus' ""L'Etranger"" (translated into English as The Stranger or The Outsider). This track courted controversy because of its theme (misinterpreted as racist, it was in fact, about the futility of killing any ethnicity), but it started to secure a small following, which grew following the release of debut album Three Imaginary Boys and non-LP single Boys Don't Cry in 1979, the latter of which would become one of The Cure's most famous songs.  At that time, The Cure embarked on tour as the support for Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees' Join Hands Tour. After the sudden departure of guitarist John McKay, Robert was recruited as guitarist for the Banshees as the band 'felt he was the only person capable of taking on the task.' As a result, Robert completed the tour playing two sets a night with The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

&gt; Following this, The Cure moved from their punk leanings into the portentous post-punk territory, releasing three albums of doom-laden rock in three years, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography, the latter of which charted inside the UK top 10, though the band were repeatedly dogged by the ""Second-class Joy Division"" tag. Following their third set of line-up changes, the group released Japanese Whispers, a compilation of three singles and their b-sides. Through their desire to escape the Joy Division description, the singles were a poppier effort, featuring danceable tracks like Let's Go To Bed alongside pop songs like Love Cats. Following the commercial disappointment of follow-up album The Top in 1984, The Cure returned to form with 1985's The Head On The Door. Featuring the singles In Between Days and Close To Me, The Head on the Door was distant from the band's punk roots, having more in common with successful alternative bands like The Smiths and Echo &amp; The Bunnymen than their gloomier roots.

&gt; Two years later, the eighth studio album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me was a more stadium-sized effort, though featuring audacious pop songs like Why Can't I Be You, it was seemingly caught between two styles. However, it was the band's ninth effort (following the departure of last surviving founder member other than Robert Smith, Lol Tolhurst), Disintegration, that would be their greatest success, both critically and commercially. Disintegration spawned hit singles like Lullaby (no.5 in the UK), Love Song (an impressive no. 2 in the USA), Pictures of You, and Fascination Street. The album itself was a culmination of The Cure's directions through the eighties, featuring the poppier side combined with the more tender aspects, as well as the gloomier facets.

&gt; Following this, a remix compilation named Mixed Up was released in 1990, featuring one new track, Never Enough, and two years later tenth studio album Wish surfaced, which was a hit mainly from the momentum gained by Disintegration, though it also featured their most famous pop song, Friday I'm In Love (no.6 in the UK and no.18 in the US). During the years following this, the band became distracted and discouraged by the lawsuit launched by former member Lol Tolhurst, who felt he had been deprived of royalties. As a result, the 1996 album Wild Mood Swings felt unfocused, and was a critical and commercial failure, though the single Mint Car was a moderate hit.

&gt; In 1997, The Cure released the compilation Galore, featuring new song Wrong Number. Three years later, at the release of original album Bloodflowers, Robert Smith announced it would be the last album for the band, the album itself being a return to the gloomier rock of Pornography and Faith. Resultantly, another hits compilation was released in 2001. However, in 2004, the band surprised all by returning with a self-titled album, their twelfth studio album, which was a surprise hit, reaching the US Top 10, its lead single - The End of the World  - becoming a modest hit on Modern Rock radio, and receiving a relatively warm reception from the press. 

&gt; In May 2005, Smith fired Roger O'Donnell and Perry Bamonte from the band, along with Bamonte's brother Daryl, who had been The Cure's tour manager for many years. The remaining members of the band (Robert Smith, longtime bassist Simon Gallup and Jason Cooper) made a few appearances as a trio before it was announced that founding member Porl Thompson would be returning to The Cure.

&gt; In early 2007 the band toured Asia and Oceania, but a planned North American tour in Autumn 2007 was delayed until Spring 2008 so the band could continue recording their next album.

&gt; The band released their thirteenth album 4:13 Dream on 27 October 2008. Four singles and a remix EP called ""Hypnagogic States"" were releases on the 13th of each month preceding the album's release.

&gt;  In 2009, Robert Smith won the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On April 19, 2009, the band performed at the Coachella Festival in California.

&gt; During 2010, Robert Smith contributed songs to the soundtrack of the Tim Burton film ""Alice in Wonderland"" and provided guest vocals on the songs ""Not in Love"" by Crystal Castles and ""Come to Me"" by 65daysofstatic.

&gt; Between 31 May 2011 and 1 June 2011, the band performed three concerts at the Sydney Opera House performing the entirety of one of their first three albums on each night. Porl Thompson did not perform with the band at any of the concerts, but Roger O'Donnell performed with the band for the ""Seventeen Seconds"" and ""Faith"" concerts, and co-founding member Lol Tulhurst performed with the band for the first time since 1988 for the ""Faith"" concert. As of 2011, O'Donnell has returned to the lineup officially. In 2012, the band added former Tin Machine guitarist Reeves Gabrels to the lineup. 

&gt; In 2013 The Cure started The Great Circle Tour, headlinig festivals in Japn, South Korea and North America. In 2014 Robert Smith announced the upcoming release of a new album, to be called 4:14 Scream, featuring 14 songs recorded during the 4:13 Dream sessions and also an accompanying double album 4:26 Dream containing all the tracks from those sessions.

1800,"EU's credibility would be worthless if they would re-open Brexit talks. The EU mentioned over and over that renegotiation is not an option.

It would be really difficult to explain if they would.

Brexit means Brexit. No renegotiation means no renegotiation. Especially not with that fool Boris, who called us a bunch of Nazis."

1805,I think it's because it was on Burnout.
1806,"And because mages get more penetration in total and do more damage and tanks get less mr total, and everyone gets less mr total, and what fucking mages do noticeable levels of physical damage? And also the idea that it’s totally a burst form of damage, ignores the fact that, everyone has 40% cdr and 3 second cd abilities."
1807,"They’re really not. If they were actually unbalanced pro players would play Blitz instead of Thresh.

1823,"There's the turbo Subaru wave too, WRX, STI, Legacy GT, Forester GT, Outback GT.. those drivers will often wave to eachother, but if you don't have a hood scoop you can count on getting glossed over by the turbo drivers. 

Jeeps are uniquely purpose built for rough terrain and I imagine their owners are acknowledging others who they presume value it's purpose also. 

The world wouldn't be any worse off with a little more comradery, so it sounds like a superficial problem to me."
1824,This is some armchair analysis if I've ever seen it
1825,A movie you know nothing about 👍
1826,Overreacting? They straight up didn't even animate a lot of it and just used bad still shots.

1828,The false Democratic/ Republican dichotomy.
1829,"You just refuted your own argument in the first paragraph. Your country is so ‘stable’ they almost had a massive, country wide protest to the likes of Arab spring, because it’s effectively ran by the mafia. Of course, the situation isn’t perfect in other countries, but it’s much better. And sure, you have made some strides towards joining the EU, but it’s just not enough it seems. Balkan countries can and do join when they’re ready. Greetings from Croatia."
1830,There's tons of good punk out there that is at least as rebellious and political as RATM but IDLES probably has more mass-appeal than anyone else out there. Post-punk geniuses.

LOL is that a thing?  If not that should be a thing."

Might as well say ""Don't defend yourself if you don't want to get sucker punched"""
1850,"It would have been a buff if not for the ultimate nerf. the W change was not a nerf in my eyes, it was a necessary change. 

i still think the passive nerf was a huge mistake that should never have happened"
1851,"Listening to this masterpiece of an album always is a little bittersweet knowing that Bruford would be gone shortly thereafter. I would absolutely love to hear what albums like Relayer and Topographic would've sounded like with his unique and stylized drumming. Alan White is great, but Bruford just did things in such a special and perfect way for that band."
1852,Man Soto is the truth
1853,The irony of the sub being called soccer mixed with English elitism is always so funny
1854,he didnt look very happy :(
1855,"French CS has always been my guilty pleasure to watch, there's just a lot of flair and panache, it's great to watch even if it doesn't always work out"
1856,"The scene between Lee and Randi in *Manchester by the Sea* when they run into each other in town. The acting between Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck is some of the best I've ever seen. They don't even complete full sentences but the emotional weight of the entire movie is carried so heavily in those few moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the scene in *Children of Men* right before the Car Attack. When Clive Owen and Julianne Moore's characters are adding levity to their entire situation by trying to suck a ping pong ball out of each others mouth. You're giggling along and you almost forget the world they live in...until they are ambushed. I loved that addition to the film. Had they been just silently driving, I think it would have made the scene a lot less shocking."
1857,"Check out Boogie - Everything for sale, it has some aggressive songs but overall very chill and well made album, or Drogas Wave from Lupe fiasco, it was the masterpiece, the only downside to me was the length of the album."
1858,Haha there was a comment when u originally showed the bong saying u shoulda used milk for the middle perc but the smoke worked great. That looks sweet
1859,"Which country, if I may ask?

As someone who lived in the US Midwest for 15 years, and personally witnessed a couple of twisters, I extend my sympathy.  It's something you can get used to though."
1860,You're discrediting Corbin's slider
1861,I don’t see Kroft making it to next week.
1862,complete game loss is not off the table with some quick innings
1863,"Thats because 2 people were chain posting all the top posts from /r/Overwatch_Memes for Karma.

In the final days of that week, the sub balanced out and good highlights were separated from the bland ones because they had more competition on the front page."
1864,"Well, they have BLAST in five days on home turf. We'll see them start their BLAST era too. ;)"
1865,"So doesn't that mean that the IGL should be the MVP, since he was able to coordinate his team to the point where everyone is consistent and doesn't have to shine above the others?

IMO Valde's point is not very strong. Relativizing players' values to their teams opens too many discussions that ignore the fact that CS:GO is a team game, not a star-game. Using his own logic I could argue that s1mple should be tied with ZywOo as the MVP due to his value in Na'Vi."
1866,"Pardon my spelling...

1872,"This is 100% true. I wanna make a post on this, but I was once a homeless drug addict and even though I'm not in a MAJOR city, there are literally gangs of panhandlers that are usually in rough shape but they play up how hard done by they are. They're usually just drug addicts or single moms or both.

Things I've seen first hand:
1. I got the shit beaten out of me on my first day panhandling after an argument with another individual doing the same thing down the road. He had 3 people he could call that drove to me within 10 mins and kicked my ass

2. They have shifts, breaks, they rotate so that people don't get used to them. They also have ""bosses"", think of them as pimps.

3. You will often see healthy looking dogs sleeping with homeless people.
a) they're healthy because theyre often stolen or borrowed from somebody and used my multiple panhandlers throughout the day.
b) they give the dogs HEROIN to keep them calm, still, sleepy and cute when people come by. You won't get donations if your dog yaps at everybody but you'll see donations increase 10fold with an animal because you're able to snag all the people that ""don't care about him but want to help the dog"".

4. As most people know, panhandlers make an INCREDIBLE amount of money if they know what they're doing. Add welfare, add disability, add the fact you don't have to pay tax, add the fact that you're probably living in a shelter or a trap house rent free..."

1877,"It's complicated, but a lot of it boils down to people quitting or being banned, and they left the game with frustration and therefore wish it dying / dead out of spite, or it's so out of their lives that they barely care about it and think it's dying / dead, or something else along those lines. It's not just on this subreddit either, it's on other places online. Some people say shit like ""I only care about Overwatch b/c of the porn lol"" or ""Who even plays Overwatch anymore?""

It's really annoying to see."

Hes trying to give them information as his voice keeps breaking up as hes clearly trying not to cry.

It was so fucking hard sitting there listening to this man as it just broke my heart."
1884,"&gt;right off the bat you know it's a political drama.

Except that it's set in a fictional fantasy world with magic, gods, dragons and in the show, ice zombies form the very first scene. So a little different form shows like The Tudors or Rome, since the fantasy elements play an important part."

1889,which is weird because then they killed hots eSports anyway.
1890,"To me...

Too much busywork in the form of constantly needing to farm something like AP. Class and spec design in a way where each spec felt some cohesion between the others to where you could generally get the gist if you switch specs for the first time, but still differences in gameplay enough to be fun.

The sweet spot was MOP, imo. One of the major complaints early on was that there were important pieces of pre-raid gear locked behind reputations. Aside from that, the patch content was satisfying and well-paced; one other complaint was that the 1st and 2nd tiers could have lasted a little longer. And then of course the 14 months between the release of SoO and WoD was very problematic. The zones were good, the raids were good, there was a significant amount of content in the form of dailies that felt like actual progress and not like running constantly on a treadmill. From what I heard, specs were enjoyable to play and the PVP was in a good place. Timeless Isle was good repeatable content and similar to what we have today with Mechagon and to a lesser extent, Nazjatar.

Encounter design has always been one of WoW's strongest points and it never really stops. World Quests are a nice evolution of dailies. I don't mind rep gating content, but time gating from one week to the next really blows. I don't like the feeling of being forced to do busy work in order to gain some kind of paragon levels after hitting level cap. I don't like WF/TF gear, and I don't like randomized sockets. I don't like there being 4 levels of raid difficulty."
1891,"First album is. But after, pretty much not a metal band at all."
1892,Imagine declaring what everyone else does with their alts lmao
1893,"that's true

1895,What exactly is that ?
1896,"&gt;I don’t know whether it would have been held or not. 

So? Do you come in from an angle that has any understanding of how basic law works? If you bribe a police officer, you're done. You saying ""I don't know whether the bribe would have been accepted"" is irrelevant



&gt;That’s your unproven assumption.

Unproven assumption? It's in transcripts, he's on tv saying he said exactly said he would withhold money if they didn't do what he asked a favor for. C'mon man

This is my unproven assumption is that he is too stupid to know what he's saying and doing whether it's in private or not. He fell for the conspiracy theory that Ukraine was aiding the dems last election and fell into that rabbit hole. He succumbs to the idea that foreign nations hugely impact the election, and he wants to play it to his advantage.



&gt;But to humor your assumptions, how is demanding a country to hold its criminals accountable interfering in an election?

Back to that one million dollars thing. ""You are entitled one million, it has your name on it fair and square, here ya go- uh uh uh.... in a favor though. Our election is coming up and you guys-""

You know the answer to this, it isn't interfering with an election to do that. How could it be? Not unless a bribe is involved."
1897,"Don’t wanna hear it y’all
Threw a championship parade cause AD was feasting on Alfonzo Mckinnie in a preseason game"
1898,I'm a slut. I'll play on anything.
1899,"&gt; I do hope English isn't your first language. 

This is /r/Europe.  Is it really a stretch to think that English might actually *not* be their first language?"
1900,"Because it's not just Trump, they have deep ties to the republican party as a whole and can use them to obstruct even if Trump goes by the wayside. Remember those republican congressmen went to Russia on **the 4th of July**? Or the Russian money being funneled to the NRA? Or Russian spy Maria Butina who infiltrated the NRA and developed ties to the Republican party? Or how Moscow Mitch prevented Obama from releasing information about Russian interference in our election by threatening to make it look like a partisan attack meant to corruptly help Hillary win?

It's not necessarily every republican, but it's definitely more than just Trump in Russia's pocket. And that's all they need."
1901,Sounds like The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats.
1902,"I just finished it. I really, really enjoyed it. It switches from  touching to hilarious to heartbreaking so quickly and without warning. It's such a unique experience. One of my favourites I've seen this year."
1903,"You're calling something a tautology after you assumed everyone has the Boralus ring.   

You sound like an ass."
1904,This Bears offense is so fun to watch
1905,Way to balance out “destroy my pussy” with my dad’s sweatpants and lawn mowing shoes
1906,"i like this guy’s review:

“As a film school graduate, I've seen my share of terrible films. Being a fan of James Franco's, I felt that The Ape would at least be interesting. Instead, I was tricked into watching a pretentious James Franco ego-trip. The only good part of the film was its music, which wasn't featured enough. Otherwise, this film was slowly paced, overly perverse, wordy, misdirected, miscast and wildly unclever. I hate bashing somebody's hard work, but if I were to sugar-coat my feelings, somebody might make the same mistake that I made by watching The Ape.

The next time James Franco has this much time on his hands, I suggest he take up treasure hunting, or anything else that doesn't involve writing or directing.”"
1907,I'm sorry you think that's the ONLY difference?
1908,What in the fuck is left about China?
1909,"Billy Wilder's *The Apartment*

I always thought *Some Like it Hot* was the best thing that Wilder ever did, but the more I watch *The Apartment* the more I fall in love with it. It's gorgeous to look at, it's funny, it's dramatic. Lemon and MacLaine are great in their respective roles, and that last line and the smirks from them are just perfect.

And the supporting cast is all around great.

I can't find a single fault with this film and I will happily watch this film until the end of time."

1913,"Well the money could have been spent better, at like a hospital or something. It is not like we are going to see this and be like ""oh yes of course i'll make baby now that i've had this pan nag me about it what a brilliant idea."""
1914,Why is our fanbase like this
1915,"Hi guys, I would like to know if all 34 victims have been identified and where I could obtain this information? I have searched and did not find anything pertaining to a definitive list of all the victims.

I would like to create a tribute to them somehow but that part I have not yet determined how."
1916,"I usually listen to Electronica these days, but this album is nostalgia on command."
1917,"I thought [this](https://twitter.com/SamLee/status/1180856992317001729) Sam Lee tweet on Man City was a pretty weird take from a guy who is supposed to be covering the club.

&gt; It's hard to work out what's going wrong for a team without their best centre-back, best left-back, best midfielder and not-quite-best-but-still-important winger

 Sounds more like he's making up excuses, than dealing with properly analyzing the game.

I think there's a definite point to be made for missing Laporte and Stones (which he hardly even goes into), but is the lack of Benjamin Mendy and Kevin de Bruyne really the reason why City have lost against Norwich and Wolves? It wasn't a problem last season when they got 98 points. If the club can't deal with missing that pair while replacing one with a £60m full back and missing the other yet **still having Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden on the bench**, there's probably more to it than the injury excuse."
1918,Here ya go.  [I love playing pranks on my friends](http://imgur.com/gallery/DxxsKI0)
1919,"Because it is not *literally* violent in this situation. Violence is a specific term related to actions, while violent can be used in a way that just means angrily or strongly. Violent is a more broad and vague term than violence."

1924,"FYI, buy one of the essences and go add it to your necklace, the other essence of the same rank will be 50% of the cost."
1925,"Someone teached a monkey in an islamd to wash it's fruit before eating. Young monkeys catched on it, old ones did not.
Soon when a critical number of monkeys was washing the fruit all monkeys from that species started to do it, even the ones on other islands with no contact with the first ones.

Kind like a collective conscience.

I've heard of this along time ago, never understood if it's a real experiment or a thought experience... But I've always thought that it would explain a lot in our behavior."
1926,"They’re annoying to do? How? They require some thinking, they’re pretty fun to play, and aren’t insanely complex or buggy."
1927,"No, there are groups, like the Abkhasians.  They regularly reach late ninties.  It seems that the physical degration we experience slows (at least) considerably around 95+.

1932,I disagree. You should have one hand on a stiff one at all times if it if it ain’t inserted into something. You don’t want it to “get out of hand”.
1933,"Right, because of an iffy call in the 2nd quarter."
1934,"Main tanks: Rein, Orisa, Winston and Hammond (If you communicate or dive with your team).

Main healers: Ana, Baptiste, Moira and Mercy (Mercy can’t be used as a main healer if you are running tanks compositions, she tends to work more as a main healer in DPS heavy comps due to her lower healing output on multiple targets)."
1935,"That's true only for minorities that are less educated.

Academic success is not a zero sum game, if minority members succeed academically, that will have a positive effect on their families and whole communities.

1938,True balance would mean that every champ would be completely identical and every player had to play under the same circumstances.
1939,"I'm not sure how Bran can be considered a winner in spirit:

  
1) the Iron Throne doesn't exist

2) The formal position ""ruler of the seven kingdoms"" no longer exists.  


If anything, Sansa and Bran are more or less on the same level - they are both taking up new positions (Queen of North, King of Six Kingdoms,) but neither win the game, because the throne &amp; position no longer exist . . ."

1943,"It sucks and a lot of people are going to think you're defending the trolls, but you bring up some important points. 

It always bothers me when someone does something bad and people are so quick to dehumanize them. Yes, they were wrong and deserve to be punished, but they're still people. And people do things for a reason. It might not be a good reason and nothing can ever completely absolve them from responsibility, but there is always some underlying factor that made them more likely to act that way. Treating them as sub-human just perpetuates the cycle of toxicity and makes us all a bit less civil."
1944,I love how they’re all perfect precise headshots except for Mercy who takes one right in the crotch.
1945,"I thought your question was valid and honest, and I went and did a little self-education to be able to reply. I didn't know that we did not count a few million people who *live* in Canada when we do census counts. I also did not know that our birth rate is factually higher than our immigration rate (this is contrary to quite a few posts on r/canada). 

We both learned a few things, and your *citizens* question stands as being the right sort of question. 

As for the down votes, there are lots of 17-27 yearolds on reddit (that is the largest demographic on reddit) who seemingly know nothing else *but* how to be an asshole online because they never have in-person consequences is the answer unfortunately. There are also far too many people who refuse to look at facts and insist on going with whatever fits their narrative no matter how nonsensical (this applies to the right and the left in this subreddit)."
1946,Allen may or may not have learned to simmer down after getting his bell rung for no reason against the Patriots a few weeks ago.  People gave Barr shit for getting balls dunked on his head but idk what else you're supposed to do.  You expect the QB to slide and you don't want to hit his helmet and give away a free set of downs

1956,"Um, GRRM said so. Why does this always have to fall back on D&amp;D effing something up? George chose Bran for the iron throne, and so D&amp;D put him on the iron throne. And Bran's character in the books is morphing into the three-eyed raven, but he's not been stolen by a parasite. Perhaps we should just wait patiently to see how it all unfolds."

1982,"&gt; This is not rational discourse.

Despite what the media says, the right wing is open to rational debate. Let's talk rationally:
- what do the statistics show about criminality in non-europeans compared to natives? You can take arabs in France as an example
- percentage of non-europeans holding jobs (especially women) compared to natives?
- percentage of terrorist attacks (and death counts) caused by non-europeans? (counting second and third generation immigrants as well)
- social services used by non-europeans
- average salary in non-europeans"
1983,I am psyched. I’m not as much a fan of Hiro and Ritsu though Kisa is cute.  But we got one of the best moments of the first anime coming up and I can’t wait to see first timers reactions. It does make me wonder if we’re going to have to wait for season 2 for stuff beyond the first anime.

1990,"&gt;Indie films won’t keep the industry propped up forever.

I played Tahm before he got buffed because he is fun, has a nice lore and interesting kit, sure the buff was nice but he was a bit too strong, and now nerfed to the ground and unplayable.

There's not really much to know, it's not overly complex. It has three sections: gameplay, stories, and scouting.

The gameplay is just [beatmaps where you tap circles.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAvpKH7LwR8) The stories are visual novel segments unlocked via levelling up and completing songs. And then the scouting is just rolling the gacha with love gems earned from the gameplay and story.

I think it's a bit of fun to just play it for a few minutes in the morning and night, and saving gems for the scouting is a nice low-commitment way of setting a deadline and then splurging without actually spending real money."

2153,"Sure.  However the decision to use Electron is intelligent because of the cross platform feature, its basically HTML5, so you can use React or Angular for the framework, and potentially just host it client-server instead of an EXE running on your machine.

The ""still suck"" part is the single threaded Javascript VM, or their programming code doesnt async enough (not sure how right away though) to keep the UI from appearing to hang because the current thread is busy receiving, unpacking, heap allocating, and dealing with IO.

This is readily apparent during champ select banning phase, because the client is receiving notifications for each player's ban selection and another notification for ban confirmation.  It might even be (incorrectly of course) receiving the enemy team ban selections/confirmations and not displaying them but still receiving them, which of course is ripe for misuse."

Still didn’t work out to well for us, we were only doing it for the Suadis anyway because we don’t like Iran or Russia. 

But yeah, if you’re going to be afraid of something right now as an American, it should be two things:
1. The current state of our government/society with DJT as our Dictator. 
2. Our climate, and the perpetrators of Fortune 500 companies that have stiffed regulations for decades in the name of profit. 

Be scared of the shit that’s actually going to effect you anytime soon."

I have 2 theories as to why the quest seems bugged, either it has something to do with people already having done the normal version for this week, or more stupidly the quest cannot be finished in a raid group, since you queue for it while in a raid.

I firmly believe that the pressure from the black market after legalization will get the dispensary prices down, just like it did in Denver. The legal establishments will have nothing to offer us if they arent selling it at about $300/oz or less. It will probably take a year or two to get down that low, though."

2226,"That's another lie. Turkey was a guarantor power on the island and with all the shit that was going on in there, it had the right to intervene. It did *not*, however, have the right to occupy the island. Hence the illegal occupation. Turkey first invaded and was controlling 3% of the island. The bloodshed ended, a ceasefire was agreed and the Greek junta was overthrown. What did Turkey do? It violated the ceasefire, attacked and occupied 40% of the island illegally even though the violence had stopped. Furthermore, it brought in settlers from mainland Turkey (again, illegally, it's against the Geneva convention). I wonder why it did that? Obviously Turkey was planning to occupy the island too. It just found an excuse. Turkey effectively did what it blamed Greece for trying to do.  
So gtfo with your ""Greece genocide on the island"" excuse. That's not why the island is split. Turkey simply wanted to occupy it."

Not this way. Not in real life time.

AQ was time gated, but it was gated based on the community. It was gated until enough resources were supplied to start the campaign to pen it.

Look I've solved the issue in all of 30 seconds!

* First one you can use
* Each subsequent one you want to use requires +1 charged energy cells. 

&gt; Hero, we can process more data but to process such an influx we will need increasing levels of computational power provided by charged energy cells.

Hey look, you still time gate it, but you allow players who want to play the game to play the game. It just takes increasing farming to do it. So if you want to do one and don, fine. If you want to spend your whole day farming for it, go ahead! And with the increasing investment needed eventually players will tail off doing it.

Ultimately, it looks like it came down to poor planning, lack of experience in the mission area and some boneheaded decisions that cost these guys their lives, and the survivor either couldn't remember, on account of the trauma, the actual numbers, believing there to be many more than in reality, or he wilfully exaggerated  to make his team look like ultimate badasses.

There used to be specs that just did not have AoE.  There were specs that relied 75% on a dot rotation and other specs that just spammed 1 direct damage spell. Specs that brought literally no raid buffs but a ton of DPS.  Specs that did really below average DPS but incredibly powerful and unique raid utility.   


All they had to do was take the class design they had in BC and just fix a couple more specs to make them viable (ret and balance). Instead they've ruined the entire concept of classes by making them all equally capable of doing everything within a few % of performance, to the point where you don't even look at what classes you're bringing when you put groups together"

This seems to be misunderstood by English Canadians. 

While completely cut from religion other than baptism, Québécois often make the gesture to contribute to their family’s culture.

The problem is that after baptism, statistics about us considers everybody as Catholics, even if no presence in church is recorded.

In political life, for comparison, the RoC and English Canadians in general appear to be much much more religious.

I won’t talk here much about the bill, but a huge part of it is that a whole lot of Québécois that support the bill lived the years of the domination of the Church.

Nowhere in Canada has this domination been so powerful and oppressive, and we still live the aftershocks of those years. While this doesn’t justify the bill, it explains the sentiment share by many that religions are inherently political and that it always affects judgement.

We lost a playoff game to the Cardinals in 2012 (or around there) because of an obvious facemask against Rodgers that wasn't called.

Also, the Failmary was a thing. 

The Flowers penalties were definitely more frustrating because of the timing but saying that it only happens to you just isn't accurate, and I'm only citing bad calls that ended games against the Packers, there are 30 other teams that you and I don't follow as closely. 

&gt;A first quarter maybe-touchdown (I didn't think he got in) can't come close to evening out either of those flags

Points are points and they add up at the end of the game, I'd disagree that it wasn't as important.

2432,"Huh, strange. When I was watching him against Tottenham I was thinking the opposite to you and that his hair looked good on him.

But yeah, in Gnabry’s defence - as someone with similar hair to him - I think his hairstyle troubles may just be because it’s definitely hard style hair to look well with mixed race curly sorta hair.     
It’s like the vast majority of us go with the Jadon Sancho style high top/blow out fade, or just keep it pretty short and simple so it’s not messy.   
And then the other small minority is probably people with curly mixed hair that’s dreaded or just braided or in an afro and stuff (like how someone like Smalling went from having standard hairstyle into being in that minority of mixed race with dreads/braids in recent years).

But yeah ultimately there’s not that much you can do with that hair, from my experience. Though some people like Walcott or Prince manage to straighten out their hair and have styles it in more versatile ways, which I’m envious of."

Check out the occult stuff, it seems to ring true to some people.  But, even back then, Humans were far more ""God Like"" than today's humans, which are deteriorating.  We're recovering from an era of deterioration with advances in science and understandings, nutrition even.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am uncertain if evolution occurred naturally or was the work of these beings doctoring life behind the scenes.  Because there's growing evidence reptiles mutated into mammals, like our beloved canines, and it's really insane.  It's something that charmed me, Canines evolved from these reptilian drakids, it's amazing. Dragon dogs, they found these beasts remains, and they were so familiar to me, they used to make armor from their hide.

&amp;#x200B;

As well as their having been other humanoid or ""Evolved"" species, Insectoids, Reptilians or Serpents, that had been killed off over the ages.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is myth that Humans were part of a Space faring species originally that were sort of stowed here to preserve the species in an ongoing genocidal war.  

&amp;#x200B;

We've been through numerous extinction events.  It's heartbreaking to learn of the other genuses that hide died out, Giants (Denisovans) or Giant Cossacks, Dwarves , (Neanderthals), Elves, Gnomes or Pigmy's.  Some may still be around, I don't know.  There may be a Neanderthal at the Pub somewhere in Europe trying to get some ass.

How the fuck is the Emerald Dream just a raid zone and a small hub for druids. Argus is a patch that barelly even attempts to flesh the planet out. All the other planet the legion held were just 2 minute daily scenarios kek. Even if the next expansion is named after n'zoth and they hype it up at blizzcon I guarantee that they'll only focus on him on like 2 of the initial zones and then they just release some barelly even related content in the next 2 patches that they'll hint that it's all connected but really isn't at all."

2464,"&gt; No clue about LPL but LCK playoffs Deft is 35-25 (58%) which is significantly lower than regular season (65%)

I would expect it to be lower than regular season, given that in playoffs you're playing much better teams, I'd imagine that's the case with most players. Maybe not with Faker &amp; Mata, but they're literally the 2 best players of all-time. 

Taking LPL into consideration his game winrate is about the same, but he has been in a lot of 5 game series, ultimately his career playoff B05 winrate is still 16-9, which is really good. He has also been one of the main carries in so many of those playoff runs, more times at least than he's been a liability. 

&gt; he and his teams didn't do well before that (not sure but I think they were favoured over White in S4, S5 0-3 vs FNC and his infamous TP Jayce botlane, got smashed by RoX in S6)

SSB vs SSW could've gone either way, IIRC most analysts were predicting SSB to lose because one of their big advantages was adapting to patches faster than other teams and the meta was pretty stagnant going into worlds. 

2015 worlds was definitely a choke, it's one of the only times it seemed like the pressure got to him and he was playing below his level. 

2016 worlds ROX was just a way better team and Clearlove/Meiko were playing like dogshit. 

I don't see the ""choking"" narrative, maybe he's been a bit underwhelming at worlds but in domestic playoffs he's usually been great and has carried lots of series."

* Defense matrix lasts a whopping 2 seconds. It's enough to selectively save teammates, but you won't be able to absorb damage long enough or often enough in a fight to give DPS space. It's also requires excellent timing to really be valuable, and most ults are difficult to catch with it to the extent that some more or less require sheer luck to eat (eg: Zarya, Tracer). Not to mention that once the enemy sees DM go down they know it can't come back up for awhile, leaving a clear opening. It also doesn't protect against beam attacks or CC like shields do.
* Her ult is very difficult to use most of the time, especially if you don't have a Sombra/Zarya/Mei ult to combine it with

* Her boosters are slow compared to Winston's jump. She can easily be de-mech'd before reaching an enemy team or before getting away. Even a lone Widow can de-mech DVa before she can reach her if DVa tries to initiate from too far away.

2642,"&gt;But the hero everyone forgets, arguably the first potential hero teased alongside Ana, is never mentioned. 

That's because they weren't ever mentioned in canon too, since that name-drop years ago. At that point it was probably foreshadowing for the graphic novel which later got cancelled.

So the thing with Liao is that despite technically having a large role ithe backstory they'd be just another ""out-of-nowhere"" hero now, like Moira, Ashe or Baptiste. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel that that's the reason why people are more excited about Sanjay, or Mauga, or whoever else you mentioned. They know something about those characters, can like something about their design or personality. With Liao we only know their name and affinity, that's it. 

Technically, we probably know more about the thief from Reflections, than about Liao. Which might be a problem with the game's storytelling, but oh well."

You think Red Bull doesnt want long-term success? They sponsor some niche events for years before anybody else gave a fuck about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The people here really are blind if they think Method only cares about the community and the ""game"". They want the viewers and the money. And they want the last say how the event is run.

&amp;#x200B;

""The possibility of Red Bull just using this event and dropping it the first moment popularity of the event goes down, is just enormous.""

&amp;#x200B;

Thats also part of the business. You can say the same about Method. You think Method will host an event when no one is watching?

&amp;#x200B;

Why are you blaming Pieces and Limit for taking the probably bigger paycheck. These guys usually dont make a single Dollar from participating in a World First Race. God forbid they NOW get some cash out of this very demanding grind.

They’re still spending time, money, and effort to acquire the information, perform the analysis, and put it to use, and there is still an element of risk involved (the analysis could still be wrong in any number of ways).  It’s their work and their money on the line.

By contrast, receiving top secret information from an executive involves no risk or skill (other than skill at bribery and stealth).  Permitting that sort of activity would allow insiders and their friends/relatives to horde the vast amount of wealth from a major business event and make the playing field even less level."

This is meant for extreme emergencies. The fear is Johnson may use it here. It’s a bit like Trump declaring an emergency to build his silly wall (when there isn’t an emergency). However it’s worse since it’s not just building a wall, but denouncing law and throwing the economy over a cliff.

That’s just a theory put forward by past Prime Minister John Major.

2793,"&gt;40 million chinese civilians ethnically cleansed 

That's was an exaggeration on his part but I didn't want to bring it up, but since you insist....

Chinese civilian deaths due to war were 7.3-8.2m, another 5-10m died do to famine and disease. All in all including millitary combatants there were 15-20m deaths in China in WW2.
Which I'm not saying is a small number, but it's not 40m.


&gt;but it's kinda totally insulting to say, or even imply, that 40 million chinese civilians ethnically cleansed are less relevant or deserve less media coverage than 6 million poles (or jews)

Sure if we are talking about individuals, of course 16m dead is worse than 6m. 
But we're talking about nations, and in that case it's much more devastating for Poland to lose 6m people than for China to lose 16m.

Or in the case of Jews it's much more devastating when your ethnicity almost gets wiped out and is specifically targeted for complete extermination.

That being said I think his premise is wrong in the first place. 
Apart from collective Holocaust acknowledgement there is no common Western weeping over anyone's victims. Everyone usually just mourns their own dead and doesn't really know much about what happens elsewhere. Greeks mourn the greeks, pole mourn the poles, Russians mourn the Russians etc. 
There's no collective *""we mourn everyone except for China muahhahaha""*

And I bet the Chinese do the same, they mourn their own dead without even knowing what horrible things happened to Greece, Yugoslavia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine etc. etc."

2939,"Other than stop doing business with China? Not much. The entire Chinese economy is predicated on becoming the no-questions-asked, race to the bottom style business and manufacturing partner for the wealthy countries of the would. In recent years it's started to turn the corner toward establishing economic hegemony of its own (read up on the Belt and Road Initiative for a great and kind scary example) but China is still massively dependant on forgien markets, especially in the tech sector. If the US, EU, Saudi Arabia, and other nations would server Chinese business ties, the entire CCP would collapse in a couple decades. 

Russia can barely hold itself up, let alone China's colossal population and the CCP's support of brutal human rights suppression in Korea, Hong Kong, etc haven't made them many friends in the region. 

Unfortunately, that's a pretty massive ask in a super global market. Even Trump's ill-considered trade war with China had some pretty tight economic shake ups, and that was just a crappy protectionist import tax. Without the literally billions of Chinese customers and producers as a part of the global supply chain, entire industries would have to redefine what it means to do business. 

Would any of this lead to an economic apocalypse? No. There would be winners and losers, just like any policy intervention, and it would take a very steady hand at the tiller of most involved counties (so whatever the absolute opposite of the Trump/Bojo/Bolosanaro clown fiesta is) but economic isolation is the only non-invasion path to forcing China's government to treat its people like...people."

So you are telling me Tyrion is speaking to a bunch of people who know nothing of 3ER and doesn't explain the concept but utilises an argument that he is 3ER as justification for why he should be king. Do you realise most of those people don't even know wtf a 3ER is or who Bran is. How can you tell me it makes sense if he literally states he is referring to Brans actual life story and HE STATES BRANS LIFE STORY.

Are you just ignoring the dialogue and situation to justify your delusional subtext? He literally was addressing lords (who know jack shit about the 3ER or its powers, remeber the knowledge of that magic is lost) and stating Brans life story."

2961,"The best way to prove or disprove medical value is on animals because animals do not have a placebo effect like we do.

The College of Veterinary Medicine has done tests for massage, chiropractry, and acupuncture.

They proved scientifically for a very large number of conditions that it does  not in fact do anything at all.

However

It doesn't do any harm so veterinarians are permitted to offer it and are trained to do it despite being well aware that it is quack medicine.  The sale of it is often at request of pet owners but never offered as a first option to fix anything.

A chiropracter refers to themselves as a doctor and give medical advice.  They aren't qualified to give any medical advice though.  That's the problem.

I don't care if quacks exist in the world.  I care that they get to be called doctors and people will generally respect their medical advice."
2962,"Of all the talent in C9A, I didn't see Keith going first to another team LMAO.

I see this as a win for Deftly, I have faith C9 will develop him to the best version he can possibly be. And if he learns to do teamfights well from Sneaky I think he has the potential to do well and be the next Lane-dominant AD carry in the tradition of Doublelift. And in that case he can be a viable replacement for Sneaky if he wants to retire. 

As a TL fan I feel bad for Olleh though. I will remember you wrecking Uzi + Ming with Morgana at MSI ma boi. RIP.

Although it's funny that he called Sneaky and Zeyzal bad in lane in an interview prior. XD"
2963,"Hi, just adding my 2 cents. The toxicity from these smurfs is  a problem. Duo smurf partners playing funnel to rollstomp through silver back to where they started is also a problem. However, smurfing, in my opinion, is not a problem at its core.
I used to be plat, went to diamond 5 and got hard stuck for half a season. That was my level, and I wanted to improve. However I started playing less and just would get carried or outplayed all the time when I would play, resulting in an un motivating experience.
I smurfed in order to get a fresh experience, force myself into playing other lanes and champs (by just buying champs I'd get the shard for) and regain some confidence. It was a nice way of getting back into form and try things in a somewhat competitive environment without getting hard punished all the time. At the same time, I would try to carry via shot calling and giving tips to my teammates and sometime ennemies during the game. And even if I say so myself, I believe me smurfing helped well more silver players learn and build confidence than it frustrated and demotivated.

TL;DR People being dicks is the problem, not smurfing."

No matter what you feel about the last season it is clear from every piece of evidence that Kit and Emilia, and everyone else involved (except D&amp;D to an extent, and also GRRM for not just writing the gd books) gave it their every fiber, heart, and soul. It matters to them probably even more so than the most diehard fans in so many ways. The thrashing this final season has received is nuclear. And though I fully understand the disappointment, I do not understand the spewing of burning hate. The anonymity of the internet allows to say things we never would otherwise, and we all know it. It has consequences, as I'm sure many will say so does D&amp;D's (and GRRM's) seeming apathy to what so many others are clearly extremely passionate about when it comes to the end of this epic tale. 

With full irony I say Sorry, Not Sorry, Kit Harrington and the cast and crew deserve an apology for the vitriol received. Though not aimed at them really, it still took quite a clear toll. Kit is just the squeaky wheel. Godspeed to him, and a healthy recovery."

3036,"&gt;1) he has no political experience.


That's very debatable since he was an adviser in banking for many years, managing banks definitely includes some politics.


&gt;2) while he is independent, there were presidential primaries by the main conservative (though now increasingly liberal) party TS-LKD


I think they just picked whoever was the most qualified from their perspective since they didn't have a good candidate from their party.


&gt;3) his actual views are quite unclear


That is true, but I don't think that's a bad thing since the president mostly deals with international politics and his main views definitely seem pro-EU and keep the same stern look on Russia.


&gt;4) Being a PR guy, he tends to lean heavily on PR


Again, president in Lithuania has to deal with external politics the most and looking good, being well educated and speaking English well are very important.

The core issue with pizzagate is the absence of any (living) victims.   But there is plenty of evidence to show the people involved weren't exactly innocents.

Plus, on top of that, most of what we tread are the outskirts of Nazjatar and the ruins of zin-azshari, and the roads are more like paths on the bottom of the sea which - well, they don't make a lot of sense, but Maybe as some sort of paths carved by bottom-dwelling creatures or by the naga for some reason?

3093,"What the show doesn’t really portray very well
Is the distinct difference in the two races of men on the continent of Westeros. The First Men, (burly, dark haired people,) came to Westeros, and using weapons of bronze, warred with the children of the forest. Eventually they settled the continent in peace with the CotF even putting aside their old religion to adopt the worship of the ‘Old Gods.’ This was sometime we assume around the events of the ‘Long Night.’ After some time, the Andals, (tall, lean, fair of hair, and worshipping the seven-pointed Star,) crossed the narrow sea and warred against the First Men with weapons of steel. The Andals drove the First Men out of the lower half of the continent into the north. The Andals could not assault Moat Cailin at the Neck however, and any further advances north were put to rest. So you have a continent with the First Men in the North, and the Andals in the south. A millennium passes, and enter Aegon the conqueror, who roasts several major kings of the South on the field of fire and becomes the first King of the Seven Kingdoms. Hence the title, ‘ruler of the Andals and the First Men.’ The power of the church was strong because the Andals were zealots and in order to aid a peaceful transition, Aegon put aside the Valyrian pantheon and was anointed in oils by the high septon under the sign of the seven pointed star. Because of the nature of the Old Gods there are no symbols (excepting weirwoods,) or churches to worship, but the Seven have a whole papacy thing going practically. So essentially Aegon ‘converted’ to the Seven to aid his acceptance as a ‘true’ King in the eyes of the ‘Pope.’"

3102,"Statistics doesn't work like that.

For example, a guy at 10 maps and 1.3 rating is just as consistent as a guy with 100 maps and 1.3 rating.  

However, with a larger data set you can be more confident in the results.  Like, given a data set, the larger the sample size the smaller your confidence interval will be.  

Like let's say you wanted a 95% confidence interval (which means, you have 95% the true value is within the interval): if someone had 1 game played and has a 1.3 rating, it would be something like 1.3 +- 1.0 or something, basically making the statistic meaningless.  If they have like 10 games, maybe 1.3 +- 0.3.  If they have like 100 games maybe 1.3 +- 0.1.  

Now, having a lower +- DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE MORE CONSISTENT.  Someone can do 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0...  over the course of 100 games, and the ""true value"" would be something like 1.5 +- 0.1 even though 1.5 was never a rating the player received.  If someone did 1.25, 1.75, 1.25, 1.75... over the course of 100 games, for the same magnitude of confidence interval, it would have a smaller +-, maybe like 1.5 0.05 or something. 

It would be best described as precision vs accuracy.

Precision is a cluster of results and would be able to easily see the ""consistency"" you're looking for.  Accuracy is simply taking the average position of the cluster of results which shows the person's average level, not consistency, no matter how many samples."

However a lot of the songs sound very similar to each other (not necessarily a bad thing since they’re all phenomenal songs). How To Be A Human Being has a lot more variety and (in my opinion) stronger songwriting, but the production was not as unique/immersive. It felt more like a collection of good songs than a single cohesive work like ZABA. I love both albums for different reasons. Just my 2 cents."

3252,"There are two main uses, offensively or defensively, so many Ana players I see are too reluctant to use it defensively to save a teammate in danger.

I get my best uses out of it by saving a low teammate to secure a team fight after the enemy has used all their cool downs.

For using it offensively the best targets are:

Ultimate combos:
Genji
Soldier
Reinhardt
Bastion
Reaper
Hog (If he is can trap the enemy in a corner)
Bob

Nano on a teammate without their ult:
Winston
Overextending Reinhardts 
Zarya with high charge
Hammond
Any good DPS player to help them get their ult faster)
Brigitte
Junkrat, Hanzo, Pharah (Depending on if the enemy is pushing through a choke or grouped up)

You can Nano anyone to save their life if you think a fight is still winable or the teammate is about to get their ultimate.

When you are in solo queue and you have a DVa or Winston with their ultimate be careful nanoboosting them because Winston does less damage in primal and It does not damage boost self destruct, when people get nano boosted they tend to panic and press Q."

The US political system is about as far extricated from the US economic and financial system as any major country's.  The Chinese economic, political, and financial system is built entirely intertwined, and the entire thing is held up by one thing; the economic growth China has experienced over the past 40 years.

A major recession in the US will change what party gets elected.  A major recession in China could cause entire societal collapse.

That said, a major global recession is probably coming, and there's no one more deserving of collapse than the Chinese Communist Party."

Oil and Gas will continue to be relevant for some time yet.  We are making strides to alternate energy sources, but I personally can't see them being our primary supply any time soon.  Perhaps that's just me.

Realistically, it's in the best interests of the US O&amp;G Lobby to keep our oil landlocked.  That allows them to buy our oil at a steep discount, which can then be either processed to marketable products, or pipe-lined to one of their open water loading facilities and sold on the world market for a substantial profit."

3405,"Yep, that's how it is, BUT it basically only matters during the lane phase, because that's the only portion of the game, when Fizz is damaged constantly for a long portion of time. This change makes Fizz slightly better against Malzahar, Talon, Cass, Brand (DoT), Ekko, Kassadin (on-hit effects, so dmg reduction is doubled, because there are two sources of dmg), Syndra and Taliyah (not really DoT, but Syndra's ult/Taliyah's Q depends on amount of projectiles landed, so every projectile has its damage reduced).

The scaling however is pure BS - Fizz tends to not built heavy-AP items early (rather Protobelt/Zhonya's and Lich Bane, so the impact of the passive is lower than it would be on f.e. Luden's user) and if he has huge number of AP, it means he's fed and his passive is useless, because Fizz will kill you in 0.5 s, before you deal enough damage to kill him or to force his recall."

new things to add to the list:

* Shaco no longer has animation cancels ( deceive into recall, tp, e, tiamat no longer works and reveals you instantly)
* backstab cd isn't reduced by cdr (thanks Darmausgang)
* ""infinite backstab"" bug, is bugging out with the tooltip of 3 seconds. Making each otehr interact in a weird way, so even the bug doesn't work properly anymore.

Assuming full hp and all cooldowns, you're much better off just waving bye after you sleep, she likely won't/can't chase. That's the beauty of Mei in DM and her downfall, she takes more effort to kill than the usual FFA regulars, and often isn't worth the time lol

I will say that playing 250 hp heroes with health buffers (Cryofreeze/DF Shields) makes being slept by Ana seem like much less of a death sentence. 3+ Shots and a grenade is a tall order when most Ana players will be right behind me as I'm waking up. If I hear her at all, enough to know she's near me for the dart/grenade/melee, on wake up I'm immediately doing a 180 and Uppercut. 

I get the desire to burst down a burst damage character, but the ones that finish me most reliably on wakeup are those that force me to blow another cooldown to close the gap, since I'm taking 1-2 extra shots to do it. 

Though if you save the grenade and use it as a personal heal instead of burst, you're probably going to win lol

However, you also feel sorry for him as you see his painful story in the beginning (as the trailers show). So I think that's what the critics who saw an early screening were concerned about. You feel weirdly mixed feelings toward a (basically) serial killer/terrorist.

3532,"My boyfriend is level 5. He plays main tank mostly, with some dps like Junkrat or Reaper, and occasionally will fill healing with Moira or Lucio. If he's feeling a bit naughty, he'll play some Sym as we're both unreformed Symmetra mains. 

I can usually stay level 4, but I'll sometimes drop to three and stay there for a bit. I try to never leave games, but I'll often group with friends who do, and it's super annoying. If I dps it's usually Sombra, Mei, or Sym and those are pretty much zero endorsement games even if we win and I get potg.

I think there's two main reasons why he gets to 5 consistently and I don't. The first one being that his go to dps aren't the usually the preferred troll/thrower pick of choice. The second is that he mains Rein/Winston. I play lots of Orisa/Dva, but in QP and plat, Orisa is still a bit less flexible and more of an unknown than Rein. Rein's kinda like Mercy in that lots of people will give you praise for existing.

We both try to do some shotcalling. He suggests focusing on providing information rather than advice. I.E. Information that is neutral without any connotations that could be taken as blame or personal fault. Unfortunately, the main reason I think I can't make it to level 5 is because of my voice. I'm a cis woman, but I'm often mistaken for a gay guy or a trans woman by people who don't care to know the difference. I oftentimes don't make it past ""Hello"" without being harassed.

From interviews, the behind-the-scenes documentary, attrition of key support figures over the years due to the extraordinary time commitment, etc, it seems so many of the staff (not just the actors) were getting burnt out.  I look at the bts for LOTR for example and don't see nearly this type of nervous exhaustion displayed by the folks interviewed.

Luke Falk was legitimately the worst starting QB in the NFL during that stretch with some of the worst pocket presence and zero confidence to throw downfield.

No one pro-Gase before the season has been convinced by some explanation that isolates his coaching as a causal variable - it’s just people that have always been against the hire using every little thing to justify their preseason opinions. These are the same people who used the “Gase hates RBs” argument which clearly has been disproven with Bell.

I’ve tried to stay pretty neutral on the hiring - he was never my first choice candidate. But there’s nothing I’ve seen so far from 6 games where a better coach would have led to a better record with this personnel."

3652,"Rotten Tomatoes doesn’t actually review movies themselves, they basically take all the published professional reviews and let you know if the majority of critics gave the movie/show positive or negative reviews (they’re an “aggregator”). 

I believe the Chappelle thing happened when there were only 5 or so reviews out for Chappelle’s special and yes, they were largely negative because there was a backlash against Chappelle having criticized Louis CK’s accusers and his whole mocking of trans people (both of which are kind of examples of Chappelle punching down). But Chappelle’s “Sticks and Stones” was a case where audiences liked something critics didn’t. It happens, it doesn’t necessarily mean the audience has bad taste or that critics were “wrong” (I mean, it’s subjective but let’s remember critics have largely given Chappelle good reviews throughout his career) but there was a disconnect. “The Big Bang Theory” is one of the most popular TV shows and critics have given it poor reviews for the most part. Michael Bay’s movies make tons of money and he gets bad reviews. Led Zeppelin never got good reviews from Rolling Stone (and this was when both were very relevant to popular culture). Then there’s things critics and audiences agree on, like The Beatles or “Seinfeld”. Or sometimes a movie gets bad reviews and later on there’s a critical reassessment, something like “Heaven’s Gate” which was a huge flop but now is regarded as a good film. And there’s the opposite, movies that were huge critical/box office successes and then aren’t looked back on well."

3671,"Depends on your playstyle. As a top laner, my Vision score and damage doesnt matter as much as say, the midlaner. A split pushing top laner needs to hold their wards for the important spots, even if it means that I'm not putting wards down on CD. And as a split pushing top laner, I'm only hitting 1, or at most 2 people at any given time. I'm not pumping out massive damage like a mage, and I'm not poking either. I'm taking short trades or I'm going forthe all in. Conversely, KDA as a splitpushing top laner does matter a lot. Yeah you can say you are 2/5/0 and be ""drawing attention top"" but the more you die, the more of a liability you are to your team. Yeah you are still exerting pressure in the side lanes, but if the person you fed decide to come and 1v1 you then you are providing 0 perssure since they can duel you. Or even worse, they take the gold they got off of your head and runs it to the rest of your team, and winning the 5v4.

3704,"&gt;Why are family ties a good reason, but seeking a better life is not?

So that kids don't grow up without their parents and such.

&gt;That's hardly reflected in the economic data. Increased population leads to an increasing demand which drives job growth. All those immigrants are going to need schools to go to, stores to shop at, barbers for hair cuts, etc.

But that would be under the current rules, not the open borders for all you advocate for.

&gt;You could have said the same thing about Ireland, which saw a huge portion of its population immigrate abroad.

During the times where Ireland had large emigration, the economy indeed did not perform that well.

&gt;I mean you cannot filter for what babies born may do later down the road either. Criminal behaviour would result in automatic deportation, so I don't see much of a problem.

We are not talking about babies. We are talking about people coming in. You are also oversimplifying the deportation process. Right now, EU countries have a hard time sending people back. How would that be different under your proposals? Why would those countries take back their criminals once they left?

&gt;Then they can keep their opinions to themselves, or they can leave. If they break the law, they will be deported.

So now you have those people here. They have kids. Those kids grow up in a family with the same ideas. They can't be deported because they are citizens. Meanwhile, people will need to live with a larger and larger group of people who are intolerant towards them. How are you going to proof street harassment? How are you going to proof sexism? Anti-gay slurs in the streets? You name it. And to what extend would those fall under free speech or under harassment? This stuff isn't so simple as you make it out to be.

&gt;I fail to see the problem of this idea. It assures that the only people who would stay in the country are law-abiding and participatory in society in either education or work.

So you want to deport anyone who commits the smallest crime and is out of a job or education. Is the deportation then proportional to the crime. If someone is fired, how long do they have until a new job. If someone arrives, how long do they have to find a job or education. What if someone can't work anymore. What if there aren't jobs. What if deportation is not possible.

Under current laws there are already tons of problems and your plan would only increase those."

Kashima Antlers are dominating the game, if I were to put in why probably dates back to Zico in the 90s leading them to titles. The same way Real seems to spun success every decade, Kashima has the pull on talents, sponsors, and plastics. I think a large number of the fanbase takes hour long trips to the stadium lmao, commendable fanbase really. Currently leading the title race with the cosmopolitan Tokyo FC and the team with the worst stadium Yokohama FC not too many points behind.

Kawasaki Frontale is another dominating team winning both titles after the split season era ended in 2017 &amp; 2018, now's fighting for 4th spot with Sanfrecee and Osaka and with enough luck might sneak into top 3. Ocassionaly the talented Urawa Reds stop choking and wins a title or two, but they'll probably focus on CL and choke yet again leaguewise lmao.

3774,"&gt; Compare the NA toplaners to EU, honestly, and you can see how wildly different the competition is.

Licorice, Impact, Hauntzer, Ssumday are definitely not bad toplaners, Licorice became worse because of his injury, but at the time where he smacked him, he was still considered one of the best tops in na, even one of the best tops at last worlds, alongside Bwipo. 

Also, besides Wunder, Cabo and Alphari and a really shaky Bwipo, I don't think that EU has that many great tops rn either.

&gt; Akaadian &amp; Bjergsen had a lot of time on the other hand to show how good they were, and their performances are not convincing enough to say they would win their respective matchups.

What performances are you talking about? Akaadian is a shaky player, kinda like caps sometimes is, either he pops off or he is kinda inting, that doesn't mean he is bad, he was a big reason, why TSM was 2-0 up against TL in the finals, if that Akaadian shows up, I'm pretty sure he can be on Inspireds best form that was shown so far. As for Bjergsen, he has proven himself time and time again and held his own against the LEC mids at RR. 

&gt; Can you say with a straight face, that Larssen would lose to Bjergsen, after he had solid performances vs all EU mids? He did well against Caps &amp; Nukeduck. Didn't get clapped. 


I never said he would lose, I just don't think that there's a mismatch there, albeit I can see Bjergsens experience being the edge that puts him slightly ahead of Larssen as of now, think about it this way, if you had to build a team from 0, would you rather have Larssen or Bjergsen?

&gt; And I don't think Bjerg is nearly as good as Caps / Nukeduck.

He held his own at RR, so I'm not sure what you are basing that of.

&gt; So you're saying TSM isn't tryharding to win their LCS games, and rather trying new shit [by the way, scrims exist just for that matter], and thats the reason they're losing?

Yes exactly and I am aware taht scrims are there to practice that, Mr. Sarcastic, but it's a bit of a difference between playing something in scrims, than on stage. Trying new stuff in the regular split is an important part to get better.

&gt; Yeah, I guess that's the reason they got fucking smashed @ RR vs Pyke jungle lol.

No, it isn't. They got a fucking reality check and are trying out new stuff to improve towards playoffs, if they just play the same passive style with Grig and try to get wins, they'd reach playoffs, maybe get to semis or possibly finals and get smashed there and then at worlds, which is why they went with Akaadian and are trying to change their playstyle towards being more proactive, as you could've seen in their game against C9 if you would've watched it and considered that aswell."

Sounds pretty shitty but it's also pretty much exactly what the US did to our native population and arguably that worked out really well for the colonizers.

I definitely don't think it's realistic that Israel just suddenly decides to grant full citizenship and make themselves the minority overnight. But in the long term I think the Palestinians have a better chance of fighting to join Israel than fighting to push the Israelis into the ocean and take over.

3830,"&gt; whole plot

In Africa during the mid-20th century, as mankind encroaches, the white lion Panja (Caesar in the English dub) gives the jungle's wild animals a safe haven. However, he angers nearby villagers by stealing their cattle and their food to feed the jungle carnivores (in the English dub he merely frees the cattle). A professional hunter, Ham Egg (Viper Snakely in the English dub), is called in to stop these raids. He avoids directly attacking Panja. Instead, he records the sounds of Panja and uses them to trap his pregnant mate, Eliza, who then becomes bait in a trap for Panja. Panja is killed for his hide (but not before asking Eliza to name their child Leo), and Eliza is put on a ship, destined for a zoo.

Leo (Kimba in the English dub[a]) is born on the ship. Eliza teaches him his father's ideals. As a huge tropical storm nears, she urges her cub out through the bars of her cage. The storm wrecks the ship, killing all the humans and animals on board (including his mother) and Leo starts to drown in the ocean. The fish help him learn to swim. As he begins to despair, the stars in the sky form the face of his mother, who encourages him. Guided by butterflies, he makes it to land. Leo lands far from his ancestral home and is found and cared for by some people. He learns the advantages of human culture, and decides that when he returns to his wild home he will bring culture to the jungle and stand for peace like his father. The show follows Leo's life after he returns to the wild, still a young cub, and how he learns and grows in the next year. Leo soon learns that only communication and mutual understanding between animals and humans will bring true peace.

&amp;#x200B;

If there was only one service and it had access to everything, they would be able to charge whatever they wanted. They would have complete control over the industry and if you didn't like what they did that would be tough. The fact that there's demand for anime in the West (and the fact some people don't like how one business does things) is what leads to competition, which is typically good for the consumer. Of course the donwnside is that one of the things a provider will do to differentiate themselves is to offer exclusives that aren't available on other platforms. But that's par for the course.

&amp;#x200B;

You could subscribe to literally every legal streaming service and you'd only have access to a fraction of the anime that exists. There are countless shows that are available in the West purely due to fans subbing the show. This is extends to the entertainment industry outside anime. Consider how many light novels and manga don't get translated, or how much merchandise doesn't have a Western vendor. Whenever there is a demand in something that's unique to another country, there will be a limit to how much can reasonably be exported. And frankly, I'd much rather have multiple businesses putting the effort in over one business doing what they want. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course the opposite is also true, and having too many options is an issue as well. Look at how many streaming services exist and how fragmented it has caused the entertainment industry to become. But on the grand scale of things, I don't think paying for 2 services can really be considered a nightmare."

What do these protesters think they're going to accomplish? For a totalitarian government, the Chinese government has shown a lot of restraint so far, having not done what many assumed they'd do and militarily stamped out the resistance. 

Of course there are examples on Reddit of police force, but it's still a far cry from ""the Chinese government is preparing to kill all the protestors because it's a terrible dictatorship"" that people were saying here on Reddit.  

The Chinese government even benched the extradition clause indefinitely, something they clearly could have chosen to just go ahead with if they so chose. 

What I don't understand is, what's the endgame for protesters? They've gotten what they asked for, and by not stopping there, they're only proving to the Chinese government that it's pointless trying to act in good faith. Give an inch, they'll take a mile. 

If the government said ""ok fine, have your democracy"", the protesters would then march for sovereignty. 

The Chinese government is not going to let Hong Kong leave China. End of story. Just like America would fight to keep any one of its own states were protesters to start revolting for sovereignty. 

I feel like these protesters are forcing China's hand. China can't just do nothing, they have to do something. Sure, one seventh of the country is involved in this, but what about the other six sevenths that just want things to get back to normal?

These protests are holding Hong Kong hostage, and again, what is their endgame? How can they expect China to acquiesce to their demands when they've already shown that their response to it will be to demand more?

They didn't want the extradition bill to go through. It didn't. Now they're protesting because they want an entirely different form of government? If they got that, what would be next?

Like it or not, Hong Kong is a part of China and subject to the laws of China. Whether they know it or not, they've taken a level of compromise the government has never chanced giving before and thrown it back in their face. I wouldn't be surprised if the government is currently throwing their hands in the air while saying ""what the fuck do you want?""

This all might be hard to swallow for someone who's fully bought into the ""Chinese government is the devil"" hysteria on Reddit, but the government is not the devil, it's clear they're trying, but they're also running out of options while Hong Kong borders on chaos, only a few steps from guerilla warfare on its streets. 

There are a lot of people living in Hong Kong who want things to get back to business, and the current situation keeps moving the goalposts from reason a for protesting to reason b. 

All this said, this is just my opinion, take it as you will."

**First-timer, knows Gundam a bit**

We're starting off well...with some fanservice? It's tame fanservice that, well, features my Best Girl so I can't be too mad. Especially when it's just plain funny. But we're seeing the new ""subplot"" of Aila integrating herself into The Gang, as it were. Complete with some nice interactions with Reiji ~~who is now a bigamist~~ where Aila ~~the new wife~~ tells him to GET SERIOUS about her possible new home. Reiji's remaining thread of his backstory is mentioned again, except this time not taken very seriously. Sei doesn't seem to believe it either, despite a good portion of last episode...showing China and Sei at least that the gems *aren't from around here.* 

But the show also seems intent on having Nils be the one to start the ball running when it comes to asking the obvious questions. In this case I don't particularly mind since he is the scientist and it makes sense for him to ask questions and investigate the minute there's something new to his eyes -- but from a storytelling perspective, it's starting to be odd. I'd understand Mama Rinko not believing it but China and Sei *planned* for the gems to be used. Why would China then think it weird that Best Boy's not from their world? It's one step forward, two steps back for the characters.

We have a bit of interlude with a new character, Julian. (First instance of someone saying ""Granpa"" in Engrish and it's so strange to hear it, haha.) Seems he has his own tragic backstory but his grandfather's not having any of it. I'm suspecting that this is a heavier reference to a previous Gundam show than the other meta references, because right now? I'm not feeling Julian so much. He seems to be introduced for the sake of just new character-itis, and doesn't feel as organic as Cziommer or the Renato twins, whose supposed ""war"" was left without explanation to us -- but at least they felt organic, like I said. Julian feels random.

Mao's reaction to the fight does not bode well...and Yuuki and Allan don't react very well either! There's a phrase in Spanish that we use when referring to someone like Julian: ""una mosquita muerta,"" literally ""a dead fly."" The closest equivalent in English I've found is [""playing possum""](https://writingexplained.org/idiom-dictionary/playing-possum), in terms of not letting appearances fool you. We use ""mosquita muerta"" when we see someone who appears kind and passive, who wouldn't hurt a fly but later turns out to be the complete opposite. Here, it seems, is the case with Julian -- in fact, that \*Yuuki\* reacted the way he did, means serious business. I still feel Julian was introduced randomly but at least we're beginning to not get so slightly into filler material, as well, the episode title does indicate something will happen...and it gives us more to chew on for Yuuki's development.

&amp;#x200B;

Julian is from Manchester, England, which means [I must automatically link this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjZZITvtZHI) (0:19 because now Youtube just decided to delete the timestamp option...)

So we get some backstory on Julian, as expected, it's a flurry of reactions and dialogue like a tennis match. Not hard to keep up but it does feel rushed, which is a new one for this show. It turns out Julian was close to being the third Meijin. Impressive and builds on the aftermath of Mao's fight with him. But *yikes* Yuuki lost to him 7 times, the scene switching to Ral informing Julian about Yuuki's current status. I'd say this was to showcase something about their shared past but doesn't feel right to give it that much credit. Julian doesn't seem pleased as he echoes part of what I've thought about Yuuki, and what the show obviously showed us so long ago: Yuuki loved Gunpla for the fun of it, and now he's doing it for some high notion of duty.

[Don't worry, Julian, Meijin the Third don't like doing that either!](https://i.imgur.com/ix3Swz2.png) (Because Yuuki fights for JUSTICE!) Yuuki's line really encapsulates his entire, uhh mini-arc? We'll call it that for now: *""But I want to find my own way...to keep my love for Gunpla.""* 

No, you dumb announcer, we're not in cake-land yet! You mean the Sahara desert! (I'll still be here all day with the phonetic jokes, folks, thanks for the callback memories.)

Well, Reiji, I'm glad *you're* feeling something, because I'm not XD;; The animation in this episode has been more...animated? than usual but the fight feels boring. I think my initial impressions from earlier are making it hard for me to enjoy this fight...yet it still feels by-the-numbers, haha. 

Your resignation doesn't count, Yuuki, YOU'RE STILL WEARING THE SUNGLASSES!

And now here's my problem, I've found: this entire episode has been mentioning second Meijin this, second Meijin that -- but the only Meijin we could/should take seriously is Yuuki, the current one, and the first one just by virtue of how *well* they introduced him, and integrated him into the story. I don't believe in firmly sticking to the ""show, don't tell"" adage but that's usually because when you set up a plot point, **eventually you'll get** *to the ""show, don't tell"" stage!* We haven't seen anything of the second Meijin to justify us taking him as serious as Julian does, *imo*, and if anything, if the episode concentrated more on Julian than what he thinks about the second Meijin, it may have connected us emotionally more to Yuuki's struggle. Julian being emotional about Yuuki being the Meijin CAN work, but it just falls flat here because we've *just* been introduced to the idea that the second Meijin, according to Julian, is just a flat-out DESTROYER OF WORLDS here. With *nothing* to show for it!

Maybe I have high standards, I'll cop to that but seriously, this line said by Julian right here, I can tell it's important and it \*should\* be: *""This isn't the fighting style of the second Meijin. Tatsuya. You dared to become a Meijin to change the way of Gunpla? That's your determination?""* And the only reason why I, personally, am amped for it is because we've seen \*Yuuki\* prove that he wants to do things differently, even as a Meijin. We've gotten sub-textual clues that the Meijin behaves and thinks a certain way, and that was absolutely fine. All it did was make us attached to Yuuki and hoping for him to not lose his way as Meijin, but to also not fail himself as a person. In essence, Yuuki was out to *change the Meijin system* and how it works, while also not shirking his duty.

And then this episode just...kinda makes all that be a waste of time. Maybe ""wasted"" isn't the correct word, but I certainly feel *frustrated* now. I said this episode wasn't starting to feel like filler and then it felt like filler in the second half lmao.

1. \[[big shrug](https://i.imgur.com/MOWZ087.jpg)\] IDK man, this episode has been popping up on my Youtube feed after I watched each episode, and I was hyped to see this episode...and I had totally different expectations for it. I even yawned during the fight and that hurt to write, haha. I only got something out of it thanks to Julian's lines about Yuuki, like I said above. That said, I've been waiting for Sei and Reiji's rumble in the jungle against Yuuki, and they'll do a whole LOT better this time ;)
2. [BEST BOY'S FROM THE EIGHTH DIMENSION!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjlI8HrbKNc) In all seriousness...I got nothing &gt;\_&gt;;; I've speculated a lot on him being from another world, that I didn't give much thought to the gems beyond being a possible magic token or a symbol of power -- or a symbol of *trust*, considering how Reiji gave his to Sei on the spot. I do think Aila is connected to Arian now, because she seems to be the only one who can *see* the Plavsky particles. That she's an orphan would heighten that connection, if she came to this world earlier than Reiji did, for example. Now that science's involved, I'm kinda losing interest *oops*. Weird how that works?...Maybe the gems just give life and that's how the Gunpla can come to life and everyone stays freakin' alive in Arian, IDK. (Oh god, now that I said that, I jinxed everyone's lives XD)"

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

&gt; Ratatat, from Brooklyn, New York, United States is an electronic music duo: guitarist Mike Stroud and synthesizer driver and producer Evan Mast (E*Vax).

&gt; Stroud and Mast originally met as students at Skidmore College, but did not work together musically until 2001, when their project was named Cherry (later the name of the final song on their debut album). Written and recorded in the bedroom of Mast's Crown Heights, Brooklyn apartment, the band's debut album Ratatat for XL Recordings was released in 2004. This album is entirely instrumental, except for excerpts of dialogue at the ends of some tracks. Ratatat has toured with bands such as Interpol, Clinic, Junior Boys, The Killers, The Faint, Daft Punk, The Shins and most recently Björk.

&gt; Ratatat have been known to remix other artists' songs, most notably on their limited 2004 release Ratatat Remixes Mixtape Vol 1, which garnered the attention of Rolling Stone. In 2005, the band remixed a track for Swedish band Shout Out Louds and The Knife.

&gt; In August 2006, Ratatat released a second album Classics, from which the single Wildcat was taken.

&gt; In October 2006, a demo album from Ratatat entitled 9 Beats was leaked online. This set of tracks does not appear on any official discography listings. The tracks consist of short instrumental electronic musical pieces and demos for their next mixtape. 
This release was followed by another remix album, Ratatat Remixes Mixtape Vol 2 which was released in 2007.  This album featured 14 new remixes featuring: Bun B, Biggie Smalls, Jay-Z, Slim Thug, Devin the Dude, Young Jeezy, T.I., Beanie Sigel, Pimp C, Ludacris, Young Buck, Saigon, Juvenile, Z-ro, Memphis Bleek, Kanye West and exclusive tracks from Despot and Beans.

&gt; A third album, LP3, was released on July 8th, 2008.

&gt; In late April 2010, Ratatat's fourth album, LP4 was leaked online. The originally announced release date was June 8th, 2010.

&gt; Both musicians have had experience with other projects, such as Mast's E*Vax and Carpet Musics and Stroud's stage work with Ben Kweller and Florida's alternative rock band Dashboard Confessional.

&gt; The track Seventeen Years was featured in the 2008 movie Cloverfield.

&gt; The track Loud Pipes was featured in MLB 07: The Show for Playstation 2, Playstation 3, and Playstation Portable.

3958,"Remember all the times she threatened to burn several cities to the ground? including the ones she was queen of and had populations who adored her? and king’s landing specifically?Remember in season one how happy she was when Khal Drogo promised to tear down their stone houses, rape their women and return their God’s to vaes dothrak. Remember when she switched from asking people to join her to follow her or die before she roasted the tarly’s father and son. My top prediction for this season was danarys needs to burn down a city. Admittedly I saw it closer to burning down an overtaken winterfel with the night king inside. But it’s all there. Did it feel organic? No. But she’s been talking about burning cities to the ground with more and more assurance and enthusiasm since Qarth. You don’t burn down a city to the ground with out killing hundreds of thousands of innocents at least. In mereen Tyrion warned her she sounded like the mad king when he told her what Jaime did. It’s the most consistent longest running story arc in the show. This isn’t bran not fighting the night king and then becoming the real king. This was there the entire time. What did you think the Dothraki were going to do when they got to westeros? Dressage?"
3959,I'm sure you'll get a million answers along with mine. For this tournament they have a format that if a team wins group stages for their particular group they go to semi-finals automatically. It's not common to see this format and you will not see this in the major coming up.

3961,"Not sure what your mentality is, but I find I lose a lot more when I focus on what my team does wrong rather than what I do wrong. Play for self-improvement and work with the team you have. Don't try to force your team onto different roles or different heroes. Very occasionally I'll steal a role that I think isn't being played properly (i.e. dps Moira, leroy jenkins Reinhardt) but I tend to leave my team to choose their heroes and play them how they think is best while I focus on supporting them.

&amp;#x200B;

Try to adapt to your teams play-style if they aren't playing their hero how you expect them to. For example, I recently had a game where our Junkrat would constantly flanking way too deep and die 1v6ing. Finally I realized I just needed to charge in (I was Rein) to pull aggro from him. I got focused and died, he killed 3 and died, but my team was finally able to push in and clean up. It was unorthodox, and not a strat I'd like to repeat, but it turned a game I was destined to lose into a win."

Just want to let you know **everything is going to be ok.**

While talking to a medical professional is your best bet, I can assure you that getting some quality sleep, eating healthy, and going for a walk or doing some form of exercise will *really* help your mental state. If possible, talk to someone close that you trust about where your head is at will also help clear your mind.

Yes you can survive a 30+ degree day. The people in the Middle East have their lives and infrastructure set up to support the hot climate and arid conditions. Canada does not, and probably will not in the near future. Adaptation may occur over a longer period of time.

As global temperatures rise we’ll also likely see the land become dry and unusable for farming - especially in the prairie areas - which are a major food source for the country. Food and water crises will cause a lot of devastation. Political and economic instability from these crises can lead to violence and wars, even within our own country.

If they were not white males, you wouldn't dismiss and you would have empathy. But because they are white you don't. That means you are the one seeing race and changing behavior because of race. Why is it okay for white males to have shitty lives? Why is it okay to ignore their issues? I really don't see how you don't get it.

4059,"I agree with this and I’ve know the Simon and Garfunkel song for years prior to the Disturbed cover. I’m a fan of both bands.

Both are great and both resonate with me. But the original resonates with the context of the 1960s which is somehow still innocent and pale in comparison with Disturbed.

On the continuum of light to dark (from 0 to 100), I see Simon saying “hello darkness” as a 10 meeting a 40 and Disturbed as a 60 meeting 95. 

If Simon meets darkness he’s contemplating using a curse word. If Disturbed is meeting darkness his mind is on the scale of murder/absolute depravity."

Anyway, he likes to hide in cupboards, around corners and behind doors and roar like a velociraptor when I'm least expecting it.

In other shenanigans he also leaves his plastic/ wooden snakes by the back door for me to have a heart attack over when I'm carrying a basket of clothes out...... nearly broken bones many times doing a weird run, lunge, leap over them.

The most recent was when we were visiting their dad in hospital (and I was very side-tracked).... I was locking up the house and he positioned his snake on the steering wheel. I got in the car and absolutely screamed to high heaven.

My brain was saying ""that's plastic"" but I was just soooo afraid. I managed to get the window down and threw it out. Gave him a mouthful and went to visit my husband. Get home, walk up to front door and FREAK the fuck out AGAIN because the fucking plastic snake is popping up our grass.

If not, a predator would have to do it and wolves or native predators have to be reintroduced to the land, which is the same fucking thing, like you said, ""you think an animal cares?"" and animal doesnt die with more dignity when eaten alive by a wolf or shot by a human being.

I am of the belief of not giving a single fuck about the morality of hunting as long as it is legal and manages by environmental and wildlife experts, whether some idiots just does it to get trophies, or a sadist does it to get a kick, or a guy does it to fill his freezer with good meat, I don't care, just follow the law and science, period."

The law of averages is the fallacious belief that a particular outcome or event is inevitable or certain simply because it is statistically possible.

This notion can lead to the gambler's fallacy when one becomes convinced that a particular outcome must come soon simply because it has not occurred recently (e.g. believing that because three consecutive coin flips yielded heads, the next coin flip must be virtually guaranteed to be tails).

Last year’s rewatch I really tried to go all out with analysis. I wanted to properly get across how much this show means to me, in the hopes that maybe it would mean others could enjoy the show to the same extent I do. And honestly, I thought I did a pretty good job; But I can do better. So this year I’m gonna do an essay a day, because every episode of this show is deserving of far too much analysis!!

And so, without further ado…

#Episode 1: Establishing Character

It's been said many a time that good characters are the lifeblood of any good narrative. Regardless of the kind of story you're working with, it ain't gonna work unless your audience cares in some way about the characters they're following, no matter how fantastic the material you're working with is. This is especially true with K-ON. As a show which lives or dies on it's audience making a connection to the cast, it's imperative this connection is formed - and whilst the potential for a show which pulls this off is near limitless, the chance it could fail is enormous. So, sounds like a pretty risky strategy; A strategy far too risky for any sane director to try and pull off, surely?? Well, luckily for us we're not working with just any director. If there was ever anyone with the skill set to pull off such a task it was [Naoko Yamada](https://myanimelist.net/people/7498/Naoko_Yamada), the master of characterisation!! ""So..."" I hear you ask, ""...this Yamada praise is all well and good, but how exactly does she go about achieving the unachievable?"" Well, kind individual, allow me to explain...

A wise man once said ""there's no better starting place than the start"", so lets start there!! As our main character, Yui gets the most attention of the main cast, and she easily has one of the more interesting introductions. Within 3 minutes of the show's starting there's already a veritable bounty of Yui facts we can gather. We know right from the get go she has a sister in [Ui Hirasawa](https://imgur.com/vRdkuUd), we learn soon after she's [a bit of a scatterbrain](https://imgur.com/kPZN5zP) and most importantly we learn how she's [just the most adorable person ever.](https://imgur.com/hrZzWbt) Whilst this is all useful info, it's all very surface level. What we're looking for is the real juicy stuff, the sort of stuff you'd have to watch this show more than a few times to catch. So put on your deerstalker hats and grab your shovels, because it's time to go digging!! The first proper clue we get to the ""true Yui"" is her interests, or rather, lack thereof. Sure, she likes [cute](https://imgur.com/Tw3V50j) and [tasty](https://imgur.com/9ZyX1L6) things, but these are hardly big commitments, nor are they the sort of thing that requires any sort of drive. As interests go, they're very passive, they don't make Yui do anything. This lack of interests is reflected in how she acts: she's [timid](https://imgur.com/HxP9Elz), [listless](https://imgur.com/rPzFKF0) and [more than a bit of a layabout](https://imgur.com/mriU9dG). This is not the Yui many rewatchers are familiar with (aside from being a bit of a layabout, that's definitely Yui), but it's an excellent starting point for her character arc, and an excellent base to build off in the coming episodes (and trust me, I'll be back tomorrow explaining exactly why).

So, with Yui done (for now), let’s get to our next two characters: Ritsu and Mio. Whilst these 2 don't get nearly as much development as Yui, they do have something interesting Yui does not: each other. These 2 are childhood friends. We can easily infer from their zany interactions that Ritsu is [playful, if a bit immature](https://imgur.com/ql1jBS9), whilst Mio is almost the exact opposite, [serious and sensible](https://imgur.com/SfXiZIx). Most importantly though, we can clearly see there's a lot of love between the 2. Whether you read that love as platonic or otherwise, these 2 undoubtedly care about each other, even going so far as to [both commit to learning an instrument in order to play in the same band](https://imgur.com/RQNTKvX). This is our first proper relationship between the main cast, and, as with Yui, is an excellent base to build other relationships off of in the next few episodes.

Finally, we reach ""Mugi &amp; The Supporting Cast"" (an excellent name for a 60s era rock band). Mugi is interesting. There's so much going on in that head of hers, but of all the main cast she's easily the hardest character to parse. Regardless, she's still great, and there's still stuff we can determine. For example: she's bloody rich; Rich enough to think a ""small prize"" consists [""a car or villa""](https://imgur.com/vA9LFeG). In spite of this though, she's still just an all round lovely person, [finding amusement in the simplest things](https://imgur.com/LrJZVNg) and [enjoying the company of fun people](https://imgur.com/KMWUsdt). Honestly, she's just pure nice. Then we've got the side characters: [Nodoka](https://imgur.com/PHcE80W), [Ui](https://imgur.com/vRdkuUd) and [Sawako](https://imgur.com/GyxhANg). Whilst they're not as developed as the main cast, we still get a fairly good impression of these 3. Nodoka is Yui's childhood friend - she's serious, but nice, Ui is Yui's sister - and she's very responsible, and Sawako seems to be ""super mega cool teacher 5000"". This brings us to a grand total of a whopping 7 characters introduced this episode!!

So, conclusion time, how does all this come together to ""achieve the unachievable"" and form a connection between the characters and audience? Well, in contrast to how much I've written so far, it's actually fairly simple. In a mere 24 minutes we've been introduced to 7 massively different characters; Most of whom have also gotten some fairly substantial character exploration, an impressive feat for a single episode. This expansive cast allows every audience member to fairly easily find a favourite, to find a character they relate most to, and to stick to them. Finding a character we associate with most is an important step in what I'd consider one of the most important aspects of the opening stretch of K-ON, joining the club. By finding a character we relate to, we can begin to feel involved in the group's antics ourselves, allowing us to truly become part of the light music club. Basically, it lets us self insert without having a generic as bollocks main character to imprint on, which lets all the characters have fully fleshed out arcs and proper development, and is super important to the entire rest of the show.

*In 2016, C4ADS used Palantir in a groundbreaking project to use open data to investigate illicit North Korean financial networks. Starting with 39 vessels known to be linked to North Korea, C4ADS analysts built out a complex network of 147 ships, 267 individuals, and 248 companies, and identified unsanctioned companies that had engaged in around $800 million in trade with sanctioned North Korean entities.*

Do you have evidence for this, or just using it as an excuse to push your views without compromise?

With policies the the legalization of gay marriage and pot, I could easily say America has been trending left over the past few years.

This is an absolute, you can't compromise on a yes/no question.

&gt;There is no compromise on whether or not immigrants should be treated as human beings.

Good thing Obama set up all those nice camps for them. And then refused to adequately fund them.
Treating people as people is common sense.  I don't know a single Republican/right-winger that actually wants to hurt immigrants, they just want to control immigration.

You're just stuck in the ""us vs them"" mentality and think that the right is evil and their views are all evil.

There's a time to take a stand on things like saying yes, climate change is a problem. However, there's also a time for compromise, like with the policies needed to limit pollution and control climate change."

Anyway, the next album I wanted to talk about was [MILLION THE@TER GENERATION 09 4Luxury](https://www.project-imas.com/w/images/2/2a/MTG_09.jpg), featuring, from left to right, Reika, Kaori, Fuka, and Konomi. Of note, the idols in this group are some of the older ones in Million Live, with their ages ranging from 20 to 24.

Both of the songs in this album are songs that I’ve actually shared before on IMW in some form, I’m just sharing their regular versions again here since I just love these songs so much. The two songs on this are [Hanazakari Weekend✿](https://files.catbox.moe/avrbv1.mp3) and [RED ZONE](https://files.catbox.moe/7oi6hv.mp3). Fun fact; in the fan-made poll for best IM@S songs introduced in 2018, Hanazakari Weekend✿ placed number 1; I guess I’m not the only one that loves this damn song. I like RED ZONE about as much, I can’t pick a favorite between them.

While I’m here, I’m also gonna share [Fuka’s solo of Hanazakari Weekend✿](https://files.catbox.moe/9xsjv0.mp3). I actually like it more than Konomi’s solo that I posted a while back."

The only thing I can think of is that some kinds of Dry ice contain a percrtange of sodium something-or-other and that it may have reacted with the chlorine. 

The only way it would have been able to react though is if the chlorine had been shock-dosed instead of automatically (fuck loads put straight in the pool at regular intervals instead of consistently having small amounts added by an automatic system) and that a hell of a lot of dry ice had been added

4356,"I've had an ongoing theory that her third death is what somehow could be the final key to all the old gods returning, which is why N'zoth/the void is so adamant about her being killed. It as nothing to do with her being some kind of deus ex machina against them, and everything to do with her death being the actual catalyst for their return.   
  
My guess was that the void is who told Vol'jin to make her Warchief with the explicit intention of forcing her to ""step out of the shadows"" so she would be an easier target. Sylvannas is just doing what she's always done with the forsaken, but just on a bigger scale. That's pissing off enough people that it's making her an even bigger target.  
  
The twist here is Saurfang/Baine would be the ones to kill her, and in turn start the chain of events that would lead to the old gods returning. And of course she has the final valkyre left, so it would sacrifice itself to bring her back and that somehow opens the door for the void."
4357,"You shouldn't *need* to calculate anything, or using your vastly superior math skills to compare 2 item sizes in an instant. No one uses dumb, unnecessary systems to flex their supposed math skills when there is a much simpler and more intuitive tool at hand. No one in their right mind intuitively thinks of 7/16 being slightly less (by how much?) than 29/64, especially if they aren't used to these fractions. But even a simpleton who has never done any mental calculation can instantly figure out that 0.447 inch &lt; 0.453 inch (regardless of the unit used, really). Or using metric, that 11.11mm &lt; 11.51mm."

You don’t win that early game, so as vlad you play safe til 6 when you and your jungler come online more.

If I were a jungler that didn’t need much if any setup, like j4, I could gank pre 6 into vlad. But as a shyv with no cc on vlad, it’s difficult if not impossible and just a waste of time / resources trying unless the Jayce is entirely out of position."

4375,"How would you explain this lack of success then? How come all these “efforts” had no effect whatsoever?  That “resistance” did not differ much form the Nazis as far as non Germans were concerned.

Btw Stauffenberg himself

&gt;Following the outbreak of war in 1939, Stauffenberg and his regiment took part in the attack on Poland. He supported the occupation of Poland and its handling by the Nazi regime and the use of Poles as slave workers to achieve German prosperity[14] as well as German colonization and exploitation of Poland. The deeply rooted belief common in the German aristocracy was that the Eastern territories, populated predominantly by Poles and partly absorbed by Prussia in partitions of Poland, but taken from the German Empire after World War I, should be colonized as the Teutonic Knights had done in the Middle Ages. Stauffenberg said, ""It is essential that we begin a systemic colonization in Poland. But I have no fear that this will not occur"".

And

&gt;Stauffenberg wanted to retain all the totalitarian, militaristic and socialistic elements of National Socialism (p. 504). What he had in mind was the salvation of Germany by military men who could break with corruption and maladministration, provide an orderly military government and inspire the people to make one last great effort. Reduced to a formula, he wanted the nation to remain soldierly and become socialistic (p. 503).

&gt;Stauffenberg was motivated by the impulsive passions of the disillusioned military man whose eyes had been opened by the defeat of German arms (p. 510). Stauffenberg had shifted to the rebel side only after Stalingrad

Then, obviously, what in the world was that penalty? Even if he somehow got away with it, what could possibly make him lead into a challenge with his elbow? Just a foolish mistake that easily could have cost them points today.

He's been improving, but his purely average play coupled with ridiculous mistakes like this just doesn't spell good fortune for Juve's CL run. It's been five games and he's improved from being dire to being average with a big mistake in him. Not good enough of an improvement in that amount of time imo."

The visuals were absolutely insane, the story was well crafted, the world building was subtle but expansive, the list goes on.  Brad’s acting was top notch, his stoicism at first began to erode away as he learned his humanity is what separates him from his father.  The writing wasn’t too bad but not particularly amazing.  It’s weird people are commenting on the realism.  I have yet to see a sci-fi movie that can be considered “realistic”.  Ad Astra was grounded but still intriguing and mysterious in its world.  It’s also interesting to see him fight so hard to win the respect of the SpaceCom agency at the beginning but the reveal was that he just wanted his father to recognize him, which happened.  What a great film.

Game is stacked af, tons of content to do and in the last 2 weeks, there is more character progression in the game then ever before in the history of the game because you want to hyper farm 2 reps at the same time to get flying and farm as many essences as possible, which also demands from you to level your bodyguard in naz, farm mats on mechagon, do PVP, Island Expedition, grinding AP, etc.

And those systems work pretty well with each other

For example, leveling your bodyguard in naz will also help you get reputation and AP. The AP is needed for crucible of the flames and to unlock the 55 essence slot on your heart. You also farm manaperls and benthic gear, which you need for the next raid.

In S7E6, Jon and his crew went beyond the Wall to capture a wight to show Cersei proof of the greater threat.  Wights can be killed with fire and dragon glass (S7E7)."

He played this extended middle part—not so much a solo as just an expansion on the arpeggios until he was off in space, and then it seamlessly got really sinister sounding. Creepy. Like Slint, if that means anything to you. It was like the temperature dropped in the room and everything felt tense and moody like there was going to be a stabbing, and then very slowly he found his way back to the proper chord progression, and eventually sang the remaining verses, and people looked at each other like “Whoa. Where did we all just go?”

The other memory is how silly he was opening for Julianna Hatfield. Weird jokes and stories that didn’t make sense. Lots of cartoon voices. He was chattier then I’d ever seen him. That was the last time I ever saw him. They ended that set with Kick Out the Jams.

4663,"&gt;of course it is, but comments are the least creepy of everything I posted. 

I'll take it at best a wash between him and Biden. He's still basically suggesting he's going to prey on her. We can interpret it as ""when you are eighteen"", but that's not stated - it's just the best possible implication. Biden's unwanted touching isn't good, but it's also non-sexual - he's never been accused of an affair, much less pedophilia. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; does it matter? would you rather someone say you're hot or would you rather them instead physically touch you? I'll take words over actual touching. 

I grew up religious, and a lot of older people I knew were/are huggers. Honestly, an unwanted chaste embrace is far less gross than innuendo directed at a child. Joe should have changed his behavior, but when I was a kid, nobody really thought twice about an unwanted hug.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; thats great, but the point is that you brush off the creepy photos, rumors, and comments while at the same time pretend to be outraged over trump making a single comment. 

Alefantis is a private citizen who's never faced an actual accusation from a child. Trump's faced multiple accusations from children and he's a public figure. You have every right to not believe them, but they should be investigated fully. You guys have really wasted enough time slandering Alefantis. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; no shit im cherry picking, its exactly what you people are doing with trump and his comments.  

You don't cherry pick when you say - here's a guy who hung out with a known child sexual predator, who spent time at private parties with a known child sexual predator, who has been accused of predatory behavior against a child - here's some comments where he suggests he would sleep with his underage daughter. Here's also some comments where he told a child he'd be back for her once there was some grass on the playing field.   


Let's look at the logic here -   


My logic is - has had children accuse him of sexual behavior, has associated with other child predators, has made comments that sexualize children -&gt; possible sexual predator.  


Your logic is -&gt; Talked about pizza in an internal email, owns serbian art that shows child victims of war, {insert gibberish about secret codes and handkerchief here} -&gt; sexual predator?  


Which one of those logically flows?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;sounds a lot like the girls accusing trump, so why the double standard? 

&amp;#x200B;

Who's recanted under oath exactly?    


Jill Harth won a lawsuit against Trump in 97. She had him on breach of contract and sexual misconduct. His shady lawyer split the cases, overpaid the breach, and got the misconduct dismissed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mariah Billado and Victoria Hughes haven't recanted - hell, he's on record saying he'd go into the pageant dressing rooms in 2005.   


 Neither have Tasha Dixon, Cassandra Searles, Samantha Holvey,  and Bridget Sullivan - but at least they would have been 18.

&amp;#x200B;

Summer Xervos has been trying to sue Trump for defamation for a while now. His lawyers have tried to argue that slandering accuses is protected political speech. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Alva Johnson is suing Trump. That case is still pending. 

&amp;#x200B;

E. Jean Carroll is still considering a lawsuit.

&gt; The issue is your lack of intellectual honesty. crying ""whataboutism"" to avoid facing that dishonesty only makes you look worse 

Ummm, your argument is pure whataboutism. It was a lazy, half-hearted gish gallop that decided that because John Podesta owns artwork that nobody should take seriously the myriad of sexual misconduct claims against Trump and evaluate his long-term relationship with Epstein as a serious warning sign.

OP, if you're interested in hearing about all of this straight from the horse's mouth, [here's Michael Chu's 2017 GDC talk](https://youtu.be/bj56ejM5EcU) about how the team developed the world, characters, and concepts behind Overwatch, along with some of the different sources of inspiration.

Speaking more specifically about unlimitedblack's comment, yes, the overall universe draws heavily from comic books like Marvel and DC.  While the word ""overwatch"" existed well before the game, the concept of ""Overwatch The Organization"" appears heavily inspired by the themes behind Watchmen.

Most of the characters are made by taking a lot of age-old fairy tale concepts or sci-fi tropes and twisting them a little.  For example, Mei was originally inspired by Boba Fett, but they reworked the concept of ""cryofreezing mercenary"" to be a little more down to earth.  They also drew heavily on The Thing for her backstory, and you can see references to the movie all throughout the Ecopoint Antarctica map.  Ana was specifically inspired by the older women snipers from Mad Max: Fury Road (hence her Wadjet and Wasteland skins, and why she has the line ""Witness me"").  Another interesting one is that Chu claims a lot of the backstory for Hanzo and Genji was actually inspired by ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"".  And of course, you've got characters like Winston that are modern reinterpretations of classic characters like Sun Wukong, or Reinhardt and Don Quixote.

Like you said, the characters and individual stories tend to be big mixtures of individual inspiration points blended together.  These then get reflected in their animated shorts, which become mini genre pieces themselves."

4738,"Okay i was way off on this lander. 

Nowhere does it state that the engine was just on/off btw. But i do have a few things to amend.

The lunar module and CSM used transponders to calculate the approach and adjustments were made. They used ultra high frequency (S Band) radio for this communication. Very simply, it used a doppler shift to read both the landing itself, and the meeting. 

The meeting of the CSM and LM were manually piloted. The large engine i mentioned was used to merely establish an orbit in the general ballpark of thr CSM. They then used the RCS (those ion engines that are on/off) for fine tuning. After transfer of crew and cargo, they detached the upper portion of the LM. 

I'm aware this information will probably be ignored by you, but i was super psyched to learn something new. In my job knowing things like frequency bands, and doppler effects is important. About a year ago, i wouldn't have understood a word i just wrote."

After a moment of empathy for those who will try to belittle or attack you in order to feel superior or to sway you toward ignorance, keep doing what you are doing.

I think you are spot on as far as assessing each publication, it's initiative and who they serve. Most funded media reporting on Iran, or elsewhere, is designed to support an outcome i.e. belief or loyalty. Most of what we are inflicted with is good guy/bad guy rhetoric where those at the podium are grounded in an agenda that is either omitted or mis represented. The theory of 2 factions fighting over Iran seems lacking to me. There are many, varied, groups and individuals at work.

I'll use the Golan Heights as an example. In this region of Syria there is a continued battle over control. If you search it out you will find that Genie Oil has projects there and resources is, maybe, the reason for ""providing freedom and democracy"". Dick Cheney and other people (used lightly) are owners. The best way to get access, tax funded support, and acceptance is to demonize Assad, accuse the regime of crimes etc.

4842,"&gt; Liberal Americans think gerrymandering is ok when it gives riding to minority groups 

Part of the thing about this is that since these Minority groups vote ovewhelming democratic, what this gerrymandering does is concentrate the Democrat voters into overwhelming Districts, which reduces the overall amount of seats the Democrats would get.  


Take Chicago for instance, at the request of the minority populations, the Blacks ask for a Black district, the Latinos ask for a Latino district, and this results in districts that look like this

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s\_4th\_congressional\_district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_4th_congressional_district) 

That was created because a Federal Court ordered a majority hispanic district be created. The District that it surrounds is a majority black district.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s\_7th\_congressional\_district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_7th_congressional_district)   


If people were only drawing districts based on party id, you could attach some suburban republican voters so that the districts are 60-D 40-R rather than like 90-D 10-R, which would enable the state of illinois to have fewer Republican districts, but the Black Democrats and Latino Democrats don't want to share with each other and the White Democrats so they don't do that.

In the South for instance, if Alabama has 25% Black population, and 4 electoral districts, the desire for the black population to have a ""black district"" results in that state always having 1 black district that always votes overwhelmingly Democrat, and 3 districts that vote Republican, but in a less overwhelming way. You could split the black population among two districts in order to be able to utilize the White Democrat population alongside the Black population to get 2 potential districts, but this might result in 2 White Republicans and 2 White Democrats being elected instead.   


Gerrymandering is often biased against Democrats, and in a racial way, but this is often due to the fact that the different racial groups among Democrat voters don't want to share representatives and so they request that they get gerrymandered in that way. Its not like the Republicans alone get to choose how the districts get drawn, the entire assembly does"

It's infuriating. The fucking democrats of 2019 are who the republicans pretend to be, with some forward thinking sprinkled on top. Unfortunately a vast amount of the country lives in an echo chamber that labels and lies to them. The fact that people think Obama was an extremely liberal, left leaning president is so insane to me.

Honestly, I'd be okay with either so long as they stuck to using JUST ONE for everything.  Drives me fucking nuts that meat is priced by the pound, but fish is priced by the 100g.  So you'll see a big sign ""Chicken Breasts - $2.99"" and then beside it ""Salmon Steaks - $3.29"" and you go ""Salmon's only an extra $0.30, I'll go for salmon."" and then realize it's $3.29/100g, so actually that salmon is $14.90/lb, or 4.5x as expensive as the chicken."

2. Low ranks have a hard time getting this but you have to play as a team and work together. If the enemy team are rolling Bastion/Baptiste/Oriss/Hog/Mercy/Junkrat you are gonna have a bad time playing Hammond. You need to learn to play other heroes. There are very few players who can one trick to a high rank.

3. It's always good to have a few friends to play with. Use the lfg function and try going for a 3 stack. 

4. Learn to communicate, learn how to make good callouts.

We got about 6/9 on heroic last night, and lucid dreams felt so good. MW always have mana issues, not healing issues. Pop mana tea and that on CD, and you can spam literally everything. Top healed every fight.

&gt; Sade (pronounced ""shah-day"") is a Grammy-winning British band named after its lead singer Sade Adu. The band's music features elements of smooth jazz, soul, sophisti-pop, and R&amp;B. 

&gt; Sade was formed in 1982, when members of Latin soul band Pride — Sade Adu, (real name Helen Folasade Adu - born 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Nigeria) Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman — together with Paul Cook formed a splinter group and began to write their own material. Sade made their debut in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott's Club in London, England, in support of Pride. Later, in 1983, Andrew Hale joined Sade. In 1984 Paul Cook left the band.

&gt; Sade Adu, the band's singer, is the daughter of a Nigerian father and an English mother. After her mother returned to England, Sade grew up on the North End of London. Developing a good singing voice in her teens, Sade worked part-time jobs in and outside of the music business. She listened to Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Holliday. Sade studied fashion design at St. Martin’s School of Art in London while also doing some modeling on the side.

&gt; Around 1980, Adu started singing harmony with a Latin funk group called Arriva. One of the more popular numbers that the group would perform was a Sade original co-written with bandmember Ray St. John, “Smooth Operator,” that would later become Sade’s first stateside hit. The following year Adu joined the eight-piece funk band Pride as a background singer. The band included future Sade band members guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman (a key player in ’90s urban soul singer Maxwell’s success) and bassist Paul Denman. The concept of the group was that there could shoot-offs. In essence, a few members within the main group Pride formed mini-groups that would be the opening act. Pride did a lot of shows around London, stirring up record company interest. Initially, the labels wanted to only sign Adu, while the group members wanted a deal for the whole band. After a year, the other band members told Adu, Matthewman, and Denman to go ahead and sign a deal. Adding keyboardist Andrew Hale, the group signed to the U.K. division of Epic Records.

&gt; In May 1983, Sade performed at Danceteria Club in New York, NY, United States. It was the first US Sade show. They received more attention from the media and record companies and separated finally. On 18 October 1983 Sade Adu signed with Epic Records. The rest of the band signed in 1984. All Sade albums were released through this label.

&gt; Their debut album, Diamond Life (with overall production by Robin Millar), went Top Ten in the U.K. in late 1984. January 1985 saw the album released on CBS’ Portrait label and by spring it went platinum off the strength of the Top Ten singles “Smooth Operator” and “Hang on to Your Love.” The second album, Promise (November 1985), featured “Never As Good As the First Time” and arguably her signature song, “The Sweetest Taboo,” which stayed on the U.S. pop charts for six months. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the ’70s practice of playing album tracks, adding “Is It a Crime” and “Tar Baby” to their play lists. In 1986, Sade won a Grammy for Best New Artist.

&gt; Sade’s third album was 1988’s Stronger Than Pride and featured their first number one soul single “Paradise,” “Nothing Can Come Between Us,” and “Keep Looking.” A new Sade album didn’t appear for four years. 1992’s Love Deluxe continued the unbroken streak of multi-platinum Sade albums, spinning off the hits “No Ordinary Love,” “Feel No Pain,” and “Pearls.” While the album’s producer Mike Pela, Matthewman, Denman, and Hale have gone on to other projects. The new millennium did spark a new scene for Sade. She issued Lovers Rock in fall 2000 and incoporated more mainstream elements than ever before. Debut single “By Your Side” was also a hit among radio and adult-contemporary listerners. The following summer, Sade embarked on their first tour in more than a decade, selling out countless dates across America. In early 2002, Sade celebrated their success of the tour by releasing their first ever live album and DVD, Lovers Live.

&gt; Sade made a great contribution to development of modern music. They dismantled many of the old music business ways and quite promptly became a fully functioning autonomous unit with a firm grip on every aspect of the recording process.

&gt; Sade is first and foremost a live act. Sade Adu said in one of her interviews: ""When we play I know that the people love the music. I can feel it."" Throughout their history, Sade have always attracted a diverse, multi-racial audience who are drawn by the band's open-minded approach to music. ""And that's the best thing we've achieved.""

&gt; Soldier of Love, Sade's first official studio album since the multi-platinum release of Lovers Rock in 2000, was released on 8th February, 2010. 

&gt; Sade is also two piece stoner rock from Prague, Czech republic. Released one MC. Read more on Last.fm.

5050,"I work in a shop that does machining and has an automation department (I'm a fabricator/machine builder for the automation department). We still have a weird mix of Metric and Imperial. Anything to do with the robots (UR, Fanuc, Kuka), is all metric. Most of the other stuff like tooling, sensors, 80/20 stuff, is a mixed bag. This sensor calls for mounting hardware using M4 bolts, and the cylinder it mounts next to is imperial. It is a little annoying."

5063,"&gt;No, he was just condemned as a racist. He himself has given us blatant proof multiple times, that he is a racist.

""Condemned"" by people who use bogus accusations of racism to silence their opposition and completely irrelevant to this post. 

&gt;This is thus, a theory that deserves a logical debate based off proven facts that condemn him as the racist he is.

Sounds good. The implication that a Trump appointed judge is responsible for Eric Garner's killer not to be federally prosecuted is complete and utter bullshit. Since the DoJ declined to prosecute, there is no case and, consequently, no judge involved."

5067,"Along the same vein, this happens in Tiragarde Sound for Alliance all the fucking time. You’ll pull a mob (usually the hyper aggressive song birds along the rivers that you’re farming for flowers), then run past some guards which’ll go to attack it and pull aggro off you. They never actually get it down past 70% though, for whatever reason, and they keep spawning guards to take out this threat. The guards do die eventually but typically the spawn rate is much higher than the death rate. I’ve submitted a bug report on it but it’s possibly the most infuriating thing I’ve seen so far in BFA. I actively stop what I’m doing to kill birds in combat with guards now."

And today we took a team as incredible as this Dutch squad, to the last minute in their home ground (and we actually scored a goal!).

So fucking proud."
5122,"I don't know if I buy the Summer Games and the Hero 31 reveal switching places, because a hero reveal doesn't usually interfere with an event at all. The Winter/Spring hero has been announced before the Lunar New Year event is over in the past. 

Though this DOES make me wonder if the leaks we've heard about 2-2-2 have actually been mischaracterizing it: maybe they don't plan to implement 2-2-2 for OWL during Stage 4, but instead plan to start publicly testing 2-2-2 DURING Stage 4 to iron out the bugs in advance of implementing it game-wide during the off-season. That would prevent 2-2-2 from being a sudden rules change that completely upends the results of the first three stages of Season 2, since teams will be scrambling to adjust to it. 

If they're pushing back 31 because they don't want them in OWL play during Stage 4, then that's... I hadn't thought about that before, and it means I need to make a new calendar mapping that out historically."

The guy above you even said ""they're doing great considering they're not charging us"" and your response is ""they should release more and charge us"". 

The overwatch team has put out 9 new (standard) maps, 9 new heroes, replays, highlights, the arcade, the workshop, endorsements (this is fairly weak addition), 3 archive missions and rotating seasonal events.

That's much more than an ""extensions"" (expansion?) worth of content. And all of it is entirely free. If you're not satisfied with the rate that it's coming out, that's a 'you' problem. Maybe take a break from the game and come back when there's 5 new heroes and 3 new maps then."

The thing is, if you don't have your essences unlocked, you are playing a handicapped character. This is not a case of having to play or use a character, it is a case of being UNABLE TO USE my other characters until I go through the same arbitrary grind on them.

Reasonable people are reasonable, they will recognize that the odds of someone cheating at a pro level are low but real, I don't think cheating in CSGO is as organized as it was in cycling for instance, but in cycling everyone knew the cheating was happening constantly ( and still is ) whereas in CSGO you can't say "" Well they're obviously juicing ""."

5193,"The tax rate went from 16% to 20% which in an increase of 4 percentage points. This could also be seen as an increase of 4 points over 16, or a 25% increase. 

Stating that this was a 25% increase, as the UCP did, was thought by many to mean the rate was moving from 16% to 41% - which is also a misrepresentation.

It just depends on your point of view, but examining and understanding the math clears up any misrepresentation either way."

5202,"The question shouldn't be what's necessary food for me as that could be anything for a starving person. The question should be why I consider fish consumption unnecessary (at least in developed countries). Simple - we can get all we need to live and thrive from other food than fish that costs less money and causes no drastic environmental destruction.

The only true reasons we eat fish is tradition and taste. Those aren't even close to being valid reasons to turn 70% of our planet into dead zones and probably kill majority of life on Earth in effect.

I do agree the world won't be vegan (I don't care for vegetarian, that's better for oceans but worse otherwise as they statistically consume more cheese than all eaters) in 20 years. I think we need 50 years. I think however that in 20 years there will be countries in EU (maybe Portugal, Sweden, UK) and outside (Israel, Australia, New Zealand) that are predominantly consuming plants and fake meats. Millenials in those select areas are very conscious about it and they are raising their children with awareness.

Every protein source but beef is better for environment than eating fish. Legumes are the best. However, nobody in developed world, with exception of maybe some body builders, eats fish for protein.

The question should have been: ""is there an alternative for Omega 3s and vitamin D that impacts environment less than eating fish?"".

Answers to those are definitive yes.

Omega 3s are best derived from canola oil, flax oil, ground flax seeds, chía seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts, pecans, to some degree olive oil. Production of hemp and flax seeds has additional benefit of not only being very cheap but also we end up with textiles as a by product. Both linen and hemp fabrics should become staples again due to their endurance and great biodegradability. Many brands are attempting to reinvent those materials nowadays and results are very interesting. Both are no longer limited to summer only clothing and basic colors.

Now, someone in the know might point out that plants don't give the same chains of Omega 3 fatty acids as fish. That's correct. Plants provide ALA (which is considered the only essential Omega 3, as in the only one you need to get in diet), which then our body converts to EPA and DHA (both are in fatty fish as they get it from algae). High EPA and DHA levels however are shown to decrease risk of heart diseases - even if non-essential, it is beneficial. Research on conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA has shown tiny conversion rates - 4% for men and up to 10% for women. However, tests were done on fish eaters, i.e. their bodies already had EPA and DHA so increase was tiny from eating ALA. That lead to early conclusions that vegans cannot get enough EPA and DHA as conversion is too poor. However, when conversion rate was checked in non-fish eaters (vegans and vegetarians, and even meat eaters that don't eat fish), it was found that their rate of conversion is significantly higher that what earlier assumed and it results in adequate intake to get all benefits:  https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2010/11/08/Omega-3-ALA-intakes-enough-for-EPA-DPA-levels-for-non-fish-eaters

Additionally, if someone for some reason can't make the conversion - such issue hasn't been yet discovered but it might exist - fish get their fatty acids from algae. Eating them directly in many forms (Japanese cuisine) or consuming algae derived supplement is far better for environment than fish consumption too.

As for vitamin D - to get enough from fish during winter (we get it during summer naturally from the sun) we'd have to consume 2 servings of fish every day. Considering current pollution levels, that's not recommended. All health institutions don't recommend more than 2 servings of fish a week.

Finnish government, despite high consumption of fish in their population, discovered widespread vitamin D deficency and was the first to test and introduce vitamin D supplementation and fortification in 1950s (https://www.iadsa.org/mind-the-gap/Finland). It was such a huge success that it's been now adopted world-wide. I'm sure you're aware you should be taking vitamin D pill in the winter, assuming you live in such climate that gives you no sun exposure for more than 2 months at a time. Those supplements are cheap and can be derived from wool, animals flesh and from funghi. Funhgi source would be the best for environment.

So in short, instead of eating fish, eat seeds, limit your oils to canola, flax and olive oil (the last two only fresh on salads, pastas, never for frying) and take your vitamin D pill in the winter (best from funghi, second best from wool, avoid flesh derived) and spend at least half an hour every sunny day outside (best source of vitamin D). Those actions will be cheaper and safer than eating fish and will be far better for environment. Just make sure you consult your doctor or do blood work so you know exactly how concentrated should your vitamin extract be. Excess is not good.

Assuming the planet turns vegan, mushrooms grown in forests or with artificial UV light are known to collect vitamin D. In a vegan world we could ensure some fake fish meat products are made from mushrooms and algae and provide that vitamin D needs naturally, with no pills needed. There is just no market for that yet.

Same goes for vitamin B12 - there are lab methods to get some leafy greens store vitamin B12 from soil in their leaves. In a vegan world we could see spinach, kale, lettuce being grown with such methods providing a we need naturally, with no supplements. I'm just continuing the argument beyond fish as I know there are some people that consider plant based diet unnatural due to supplements. We have to take supplements only because of sanitation, artifical light, 9-5 work hours and that all focus on vitamins and minerals is around typical diet. In vegan world all of those are solvable."

I'll go through each of your points (many of which we mostly agree as most are more due to my experience in a semi isolated area of Ontario, 800 km in west or south to a city with a population over 800,000 and 800 km east for 98,000 people, which is anecdotal I grant but less on media reporting)

1) This is partially coming from the perspective of a new type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 16 currently 18) there is plenty of technology the United states has that we simply do not allow in Canada that has been operating completely safely and really benefiting the lives of diabetics 

2) I seem to have failed to convey what I meant, I never meant to suggest that Canadian doctors who currently exist and operate in Canada would be serving the best interests of their patients by moving to the US. Instead I meant it more ""why should future doctors who were born in Canada not just train and live in the united states if money is their largest driving factor besides medicine"" this is clearly my fault on reread and I certainly could have been more clear in my sentence choice. Where I live there is certainly a shortage of doctors and more needs to be done to combat the problem.

3) I totally understand what I want to do is the definition of niche medical care that the government would be criminally immoral to prioritize over primary care. Naturally the brunt of government funds cannot and should not be committed to doctors in that field. I mainly brought it up to demonstrate the perspective I am coming from and it was never my intention to make it about them but to demonstrate that despite everything I was about to say about US I'm still planing on helping Canadians with these issues.

4) While there are plenty of states and anecdotes on the internet I have been personally affected my long wait times for procedures and specialists. I do realize this is partially a money issue however at least in Northwestern Ontario connections are what guarantees citizens access to priority healthcare. These bellow anecdotes are that, anecdotes however these anecdotes could quickly become a statistic if I polled my entire city. 

One Anecdote: Three is a combination of personal experience and statistics I've found, I've had serious movement related problems recently and I had the ER flat out send me home just after I had lost the ability to use my right leg and arm was failing to ""come back if the problem spread to the other leg""  (kinda paraphrase because this was months ago but this is the general meaning). My family doc wrote up a MRI request to be a priority in the next 10 days and instead they deemed it a non priority and scheduled it for August (this was in April after being sick since December), bear in mind that before I was sick I was one of the best track athletes in my city and type one diabetic for little over a year. A couple days later with the combine pressure of familiar connections and friends I managed to get a reasonable ER doc who immediately got me an MRI (they were looking for MS) and due to the movement problems I was twitching during the MRI somewhat which according to 4 different docs left partial blurring on the result. Following that whole incident its months between specialist appointments with little work treating me actually in the hands of actual doctors. Instead I've done almost all of the legwork with my family doc even commenting that my theory seamed most logical and now thanks to my own treatment, which I only started with my doctors blessing I'm not a fool who thinks reading some physiology and pathology makes them a doctor, I can temporarily completely remove the problem in my leg and occasionally in my arms.

Second Related Anecdote: When I got a referral to a movement specialist in southern Ontario I was told my appointment would be in fall 2020, however since:
My father ran with a man, 
Whose brothers a doctor in Southern Ontario
And has a daughter was best friends with the daughter of the movement specialist
I was able to move my September 2020 appointment to this July due to being put on a priority cancellation list 
God forbid someone who is less connected gets sick and needs to see a similar specialist (and doesn't spend months researching medicine to try and fix themselves in the meantime)

These personal anecdotes have naturally left me jaded to the state of Canadian healthcare but might clear up my opinions on the matter.

5) About money, I never meant to nobly take any pay cut. I don't care as much about money as I do medicine. I could easily go into many different industries if money was my sole interest. I couldn't give a damn if I'm paid 1/4th the price of what I could get in the states (so long as it covers my modest living expenses/debt for crying out loud I never bought a car because I loved biking too much and because its a waste of money here) if it means I get to help pioneer the field of medicine I want to enter into my main point is that if we want to encourage more people to enter GP medicine we need to provide more incentives for Canadians to enter the field compared to the incentives US citizens receive from being in Canada.

Sorry if this is a bit of a rambling mess, I haven't slept in over 24 hours due to the above mentioned mystery illness and I am killing time until I fall asleep from exhaustion. I've used too many () &lt;---- (I'm too tired to remember what these are called just that it is improper) instead of proper sentences and have probably committed unforgivable sins against grammar elsewhere (and probably here too). 

Thanks for sending me the long and thought out reply, if you respond I'll likely not respond for several hours but I do try to respond to every comment I make that isn't a joke. It's good to have responses from in the field."

5431,"About Charles Dance last interview:

5434,"The efficacy is arguable, but a lot of companies are using “micro-influencers” that have significantly smaller followings. These are people that treat IG as a hobby or pipe-dream rather than an actual profession and can often be paid peanuts or more often just given perks, free merchandise or commission with promo code. Its all just a branding opportunity anyway and while micro-influencers have much smaller followings, they typically engage with them quite a bit, which is a big plus. 

I don’t do any of that stuff, but from what I’ve heard and IMO micro-influencers offer a significantly better ROI and social media celebrities like you mentioned are just too expensive for what they offer."

For one, the very peculiar proportions of the Duomo resulted in very small windows, which made the interior quite dark especially for a Gothic cathedral (which is supposed to have large windows that take up most of the surface area so that there can be as much light as possible going inside) and therefore meant that it needed artificial lighting even during the day. There should have been either fewer aisles or taller aisles and much taller nave in order to correct this.

Because of that proportion, it led to the very odd (in my opinion anyway) triangular facade with the mismatched Renaissance details. There were [a host of various other facade proposals](https://www.gettyimages.com/search/more-like-this/1035015910?family=editorial&amp;phrase=duomo%20di%20milano%20design&amp;recency=anydate&amp;sort=best&amp;page=1&amp;suppressfamilycorrection=true#license) which looked far better than the current facade of the Duomo."

The roofer that did the work found two things that were an issue with the roof. The wood that had been used for the roof was still ""green"" so it had split in all over the place as it dried out. This caused splintering. It was fine until the house settling cause some of these splints to poke through the roofing materials. He also pointed out that when the previous owners put in blow-in insulation it covered up the soffits. This was preventing proper air flow in the attic causing mold starting to form. 

On further inspection the soffits that were there were actually fake, there was solid wood behind them. So I had to remove all the soffits and the wood and put in new soffits.

Because I went from a mossy tar and gravel roof to a metal roof, that caused more issues the next major rain fall. Turns out the tar gravel and all the moss held the water and slowed it from going down the down spouts into the drain tiles. The metal roof let all the water go down the spouts ASAP, but the cement tubes around the house had collapsed and couldn't take all the water so the basement flooded. I had to dig up all the drainage and put new plastic pipes in."

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

5853,"Also experienced this in a game last night; it doesn't do **no** damage, just very little damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Server: NA

Type of Bug: In-Game Bug

Description: Azir's Sun Disc is only doing the damage of the increased AD from his AP -&gt; Tower AD conversion and not doing any damage from the base AD the tower is supposed to have.

Insert Video: [https://youtu.be/lXW7DF4eXl8](https://youtu.be/lXW7DF4eXl8) is in game footage from a live ranked game last night. [https://youtu.be/Pe9\_DFnECh4](https://youtu.be/Pe9_DFnECh4) is from a Practice Tool game with the same level and items as my former teammate from last night which showed the same results. [https://youtu.be/vZSGWIhEKeU](https://youtu.be/vZSGWIhEKeU) is from a second Practice Tool game using a skin to verify that it wasn't related to the base skin of Azir and to test with a different amount of AP. This was 100% reproduced and the results were the same every time I tried it; the base AD of the turret is not actually functioning when it fires shots and is only doing damage according to the AP scaling of Azir's passive, as you can see in the third video where I highlight his passive to show the 47 damage scaling his AP is giving his Sun Disc and then go over the minion's health bar to show that every hit is doing exactly 47 damage to the minions.

Reproduction Rate: 100%

Steps to Reproduce: Place Sun Disc on broken tower rubble. Tower targets enemy minions and attacks.

Expected Result: Damage dealt based on Azir's stats and passive AD from Sun Disc's tower stats.

Observed Result: Minions were taking damage equal to the AP scaling of Azir's passive but not the base AD of the Sun Disc's tower stats.

1 level every 15 minutes. Also maybe you should ask /u/DesMephisto for help or just use AAP because if it really took you 44 hours from 20-110 then you obviously spent more than half that time alt tabbed or doing nothing of value. It literally takes less than 48 hours to go all the way to 120 and thats if youre not paying attention at all.

5937,"&gt; What does this even mean? ""Professions"" don't make mistakes - people do.

Professions are made up of people. As you said. People make mistakes. When they make those mistakes within the scope of that profession the profession has some responsibility, if it wishes to be taken serious as a profession, to take corrective action. That's why things like the Bar Association exist.

I don't make any conclusions about the media as to how it deals with Trump. I think in general there's way too much concern about making money with news but just because the mainstream media did a massive disservice to one man and to the country with their coverage of one event that doesn't mean that the mainstream media is always wrong. And it certainly doesn't invalidate the critical mission journalism plays in our republic. What it does show are symptoms that things aren't being done for the right reasons. But that doesn't mean that the results are always corrupt. For example if the news can make the most money by reporting some event completely honestly with no bias and just the facts they will tend to do that and in that instance they serve their public trust just as they were designed to do. 

It's when the money runs contrary to the truth that our media runs into problems. With Trump it's all just a massive car accident on the highway. Almost no one can look away. So anything they report is going to make money. So there's very little reason (political bias being the strongest but still not nearly as strong as the cash grab that is this entire administration) for anyone to bother not reporting truth when it comes to Trump."

5949,"&gt;ow the western left think expecting assimilation is a right wing idea

Assimilation of existing historical minorities **is** a right wing idea - i.e. wanting to assimilate *all* Latvian Russians is wrong, since there are Latvian Russians whose bloodlines range back centuries - before our nation state ever existed. 

It's a question of context, not just a broad ''assimilation = right wing''. It's also a question on what we perceive as the cultural aspects that require assimilation - e.g. can an assimilated Latvian be muslim or not? Am I a true Latvian if I am an atheist - and if I am does that mean that one can assimilate by becoming non-religious? 

An example closer to the West - Catalonia. Is it reasonable for someone to expect Catalonians to assimilate or not into Castilian culture if they move to e.g. Madrid? Should Catalonians assimilate into Castilian culture by the nature of living in Spain? 

These are nuanced questions which are discussed by many on the left, you're talking about Tumblerinas and loud-mouthed attention seeking twats who just want to shut down all discussion, yet these voices barely if at all represent the left, because they hate me just as much as they hate you."

5974,"In Nunavut, there's pretty much just one indigenous language family that is common, and it's unsurprisingly the Inuit language family, with Inuktitut being the most common one by far.  As a first language, Inuktitut speakers outnumber English speakers about 2:1, who outnumber French and Inuinnaqtun speakers about 20:1, so that shows how much Inuktitut and English are by far the main languages of the territory.  NWT has many more indigenous languages spoken there.  Additionally, Inuinnaqtun is pretty darn closely related to Inuktitut, so it's even more homogenous for indigenous languages.

The smaller the community, the less likely one is to hear English.

Yes, plenty of documents printed in Inuktitut.  Fewer books.  At higher education levels, there's less content available in Inuktitut, which can result in losing it as a working language, or a high incidence of code switching (mixing of languages).

Many languages never had a written form, and had one created and introduced by missionaries to screw them up like any other ethnic group who had Jesus nonsense forced on them.  Although essentially completely unrelated, the script was created for use for other indigenous languages and adapted for use in Inuktitut.

I personally don't care for the use of syllabics.  Some people argue that it's tradition, but it's a relatively short one.  Furthermore, it wasn't created by any indigenous person, isn't particularly well suited for any of the languages that use them, is a barrier to learning the language for many people, and hinders its use in print and digital media.  While the use of syllabics can help isolate it from English influences, its number of speakers isn't particularly high and it could use some help to keep it from dying.  The language family has some very closely related dialects from Alaska to Greenland, and Greenlandic (very close to Inuktitut but written with the Latin alphabet) has a stronger base in my opinion.  While a separation of dialects might help keep them distinct and each alive for a bit longer, it'll keep the whole language family at much higher risk than if there were to be a natural blending of all dialects to boost the number of speakers and media available to keep the language alive."

US drug cartels? Really? The article itself only mentions Mexican drug cartels. 

&gt; Even Mexican drug cartels seem to want a piece of the avocado business. Due to its weather and geography, the Mexican state of Michoacan has become a hub for the production of synthetic drugs and, simultaneously, a ""paradise"" for the cultivation of avocados.

&gt; While drug cartels routinely threaten and extort money from farmers, avocado shipments are also often being attacked.

I speak French and understand it fluently, having done all my education in French schools/programs, but since I write much less and use it less in my day to day life, I’m often looking things up to make sure I’m using appropriate grammar when I write in French and it’s simply easier for me to write in English. Others will take even more time time and effort to write in another language. Beyond that, we are a bilingual country and this is a bilingual subreddit."

6049,"Well, for all we know the pre-patch even could be when shit hits the fan. Aside from N'Zoth now being freed we still have some particular questions that are still unanswered and events that we know are coming but nothing's happened yet.

Like, what's up with the dagger now? We're all assuming Sylvanas and Nathanos knew what they were doing in the middle of the ocean before Nazjatar was opened up to us. But was that really the intent and what happens now?

Or, what will Thrall, Baine, Saurfant, Jaina and Metthias Shaw and co. do? We (The Horde) knows that both Lorthemar and Thalysra decided to focus their efforts in recaiming the Tidestone and stopping Azshara (which we did/do) as a means to stop the fighting between Horde and Alliance. I'm assuming Jaina has the same though, work together to stop this needless fight. Now that we've started this path, what's next in store? Clearly Lorthemar and Jaina were at friendly terms in the cinematic. So is it safe to assume they will start plotting?

I think something needs to be done with the ""faction war"" thus far before N'Zoth can be dealt with. A fight/war with one singular enemy is far more favorible than a war with two enemies, stragically speaking. I'd image both Jaina and Lorthemar realize this. Only by standing together do both the Horde and Alliance forces even stand an inkling chance of coming out of a battle with a fully released Old God with a restored all powerful lackey at their side."

6051,"There are a few potential reasons:

1. Ana's darts have quite a large collision box anyway, but when you're firing at allies they also have increased hitboxes so that you don't miss as many shots.
2. Ana's weapon can't make critical hits, so you don't need to be as precise. (In fact, you'll hit more shots on moving targets if you aim *lower,* as the hitbox around a running character's legs / feet seems to be a trapezoid that gets wider at the feet, rather than the rectangular hitbox for their torso / head.)
3. You might have different 'relative sensitivity while zoomed' values for each of the scope-based heroes."

6075,"Great response. Wish I was rich enough to give you Reddit Gold.

A huge factor in this is that the Canadian core values of looking out for each other and treating everyone fairly and politely is coming under strain from the economic woes most of Canada currently faces from the disdevelopment of our urban environments in a post-NAFTA era (I'm talking about how any career jobs that allow for people to save for the future and come out ahead now all require a three year diploma or degree or certificate whereas in the past an unskilled person could be a warehouse person, tailor or a sausage-maker like my grandmother-in-law and still save enough for retirement and a house as a sausage-maker).

The job insecurity and impoverishment of our unskilled classes is leading to group- and class-warfare in both Canada and USA. Whereas Canada has it a bit less than USA, the flames of hatred are being fanned in both countries by politicians that also cater to cronies and the rich instead of looking out for the unskilled people (even as they claim on their ads to be ""for the people"" once you see their legislative agenda and machinations you notice they probably meant ""for the rich cishet straight Christian male people"").

This is causing underfunding of our healthcare and medical systems and the uninformed person unwilling or unable to look at the macro trends and that barely reads Canadian news but votes in Canada thinks ""Oh atleast we're better than the States, that's good enough"". 

But it isn't! Once you remove America from the stats and look at our comparison with other comparable countries like Denmark, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France and even Italy, Canada's healthcare is suffering and much worse than other countries and I think a big source of the problem is wage-underfunding and the lack of enough doctors/nurses and the lack of teaching spaces and also barricades against foreign doctors practicing here via both lack of spaces and lack of funding (let alone the three+-yr retraining required which TBF I don't know if it's possible to reduce/remove that).

Canada needs to get it's priority straight and build up it's healthcare infrastructure and also start giving educational grants/loans that fully fund the cost of medical education for people. The reasons why we have foreign-trained doctors driving taxis instead of being a family doctor need a Parliamentary inquiry and following that the subsequent removal of the systemic barricades keeping these foreign-trained doctors underemployed.

As for the money motive, agreed it's pervasive and corrupting but that's because we're running a corporate system on public funds. I personally would have loved if we had the NHS model of a public system with doctors being paid by the government like they have in Scotland but it's likely too entrenched now for provincial governments to change or fight the political power of groups like UHN or Mt Sinai."

6088,"Pretty much, I don’t agree with Johnson and he made a bad choice by proroguing parliament for so long because it looks bad but he really didn’t take much if any time away from the possible debates. But equally if he wanted a Queen’s Speech he would probably have taken more time out of the legislative schedule by only proroguing after the conference recess, 4-7 days is normal for that. 

To anyone that doesn’t know, Parliament would have been in recess for 3-4 working weeks anyway from the 10th(ish) of September because of the party conferences - why we agreed to a brexit deadline happening right after conference season I don’t understand, it was not a good move by Macron to put his foot down on that. The 3 or 4 question depends on if the recess was to include the SNP conference which doesn’t end until the 14th of October - which is when the Queen’s Speech is scheduled. 

Anyone who was paying attention knew that the first week back after summer was the only chance for parliament to do anything anyway because of the conference recess - this was talked about before the summer break when there was talk of a no confidence motion before the break, after that didn’t really happen everyone was saying there are 3 days in September where they can really do something. That hasn’t actually changed.

We can rightly will blame Boris for pushing no deal, but the opposition have been fucking awful for years now and they aren’t getting better. They need to take as much blame here, they took over the running of parliament for days and managed to agree on absolutely nothing.

China would rather wait out the protests and slowly erode rights for the next couple decades until HK is indistinguishable from the rest of China rather than just kill everyone.

The Braves moved their field [in part because of racial fears](http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2013/11/21/6275/do-the-braves-really-just-think-their-fans-are-afraid-of-black-people/).

I live in Seattle now and you don't see any of that stuff.

6189,"Jamie stepped outside for a mere moment to catch his breath. He had held it in for far too long. He took this opportunity of solitude to pass gas. The gas passed through his sphincter and made a squeaky sound like that of an old wooden door closing. ''What a dirty little boy I am.'' Jamie whispered to himself while cracking a little smile.

He looked over at Bran confined to his wheelchair. Bran was gazing into the horizon as that was all he was known for doing these days.

''I should've dropped a heavy rock on him after I pushed him out of the window.'' Jamie whispered to himself.

Jamie started walking slowly towards the cripple. He stopped behind him for a brief moment and put a hand on his shoulder.

Bran nodded, acknowledging Jamie's presence while continuing staring off into the horizon.

''What are you doing here?'' Bran asked.

''I just wanted to have a chat with you. About the incident.'' Jamie replied while his eyes were fixated on the ground.

''So Bran. I just wanted to apologize for what I did to you.’’ Jaime said nervously.

‘’I assume your legs don’t work at all? You can’t walk or run anymore?’’ Jamie continued

''I'm afraid not. But it does not matter for I am not Bran anymore. I am the third eyed raven. I don't need my legs to utilize my powers.'' Bran replied continuing his gaze toward the horizon.

‘’I am so deeply regretful for what I did to you. I would give my life to take back what I did to you.’’ Jamie said while looking at Bran.

''Don’t. I would argue you did me a favor by crippling me. The whole incident sparked a chain of events that has been very beneficial for me. Haven't I told you? I am going to be the new king. I am going to take the throne from Cersei, burning all of Kings Landing doing so.'' Bran said with a smug tone.

''Oh is that so?'' Jamie replied.

Jamie clenched his jaws for a few seconds while staring towards the horizon as well.

''I never liked you Bran. You know that? The mere sight of you makes me want to vomit. You are USELESS and have been USELESS this whole time and now you’re going to become a king and steal the throne from my beloved Cersei while having done absolutely nothing!? Do you know how many people died for you?''

''I appreciate their sacrifice and I would argue it was for the greater good.'' Bran replied confident in his tone.

''The greater good? PODRICKS DICK HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN YOU AND MORE THAN YOU EVER WILL! YOU CAN SEE THE FUTURE, YOU HAVE THESE VISIONS AND ALL THESE INCREDIBLE POWERS. YET YOU’VE SHOWN NO INTENTION ACTUALLY USING THEM!’’ Jamie screamed.

''I beg to differ. I did use them. I'm going to be king now. Don't you see?'' Bran said in a smug tone while smirking.

''You know what? I'm gonna do what I've always wanted to do to you.'' Jamie said while starting to unbuckling his belt.

''Are you going to end me like you did the others, Kingslayer?'' Bran replied in a calm manner.

''No, watch me cripple. And what happened to you being able to see the future?'’ Jamie asked.

''I guess the writers forgot.'' Bran replied while starting to appear a little nervous.

''I'm going to do what I've wanted to do ever since I first laid my eyes upon you. I'm gonna fart you in thy face, that’s what I'm gonna do and there is nothing you can do to stop it.'' Jamie said while hastily unbuttoning his pants with his single hand.

''Can’t you see? I'm the third eyed Raven. Nothing you do can faze me.'' Bran replied while looking into Jamie’s eyes.

‘’Oh, we’ll see about that’’ Jamie said while pulling his pants down to his ankles, exposing his buttcheeks.

''Have you ever heard of a dish called Surströmming? It's a northern delicacy from what I’ve heard. It consists of fermented fish that has this god awful smell to it. It's basically salty, rotten fish that these savages in the north considers fine dining. The taste is absolutely horrendous but for you Bran.. I ate five whole cans.''

''No you wouldn't. You will get hanged for this!’’ Bran shouted while struggling to get out of his wheelchair.

''Not so content being a cripple anymore, huh?'' Jamie said while pressing his buttcheeks against Brans face.

Jamie used all his might to push out the loudest fart the seven kingdoms has ever heard. Unfortunately he accidently pushed a little too hard and a spray of feces hit Bran in his mortified face making him fall out of his wheelchair onto the ground.

Kingsprayer.

Jamie started laughing. He couldn't breathe he laughed so hard.

Then the smell hit them.

Bran started dry heaving ''Oh god the smell, I can’t take it.''

''It's not of this world. You’ve summoned a demon!'' Bran said while a projectile of vomit spurted out of his mouth.

Bran started bursting out in tears. ''Please Sir Jamie. I'll do anything you want. Just please let me go. I can't take it anymore.''

Jamie farted again in Brans face for good measure. ‘’That’s for everything, you cunt. I’m leaving for Kings Landing tomorrow.’’

Bran passes out by the smell, lying unconscious in his own vomit.

Jaime sighed while pulling up his pants with his one hand.

''The things we do for love.’’"

Alberta has rapidly lost investment from numerous companies due to the lack of transportation for crude or refined product. If more companies invest and can move more product then that means more royalties. More royalties effects equalization. 

The math is pretty simple. Last year Quebec received 11.7 billion dollars of the 19 billion total in payments. Since its inception in 1957 the province has received over HALF of the total equalization payments.

As a recessive trait it must be inherited from both parents to cause the hair to become red. From a historical perspective its interesting that the red headed gene turns up in some historically very important parts of the world, including China, Central Russia, the Caucasus region and North Africa over 10,000 years prior to the Northern western European tribes of the last 2000 years. Does this have to do with hiding history prior to the AD era which has been predominantly written and put forth by Ashkenazi Jews in the last century?

https://www.eupedia.com/genetics/origins_of_red_hair.shtml

W  is more about damage than shield, the shield os just ""a nice addition"" similar to arhis Q heal, it's super handy, but definitely a secondary use for the ability. And is always a little unreliable to proc the 2nd half of, but QRWR is a ton of damage. her passive is almost extra power since it's unreliable in a team fight half the time. But it's really good if you get it off or set up for it.

She's usually either dominant or irrelevant in a game."

6377,Look If I was Ukrainian I would feel the same as you do. I just think that Ukraine is used as a proxy war between Russia an America and have a slightly nuansed opininon that Nato good Russia bad. Yeah it is shit what is hapenning in Ukraine but I can get why it happened. Does it justify it? Apsolutley not! In my opinion very few things justify war. Apsolutley nothing can justify civilian casualties IMO. But I feel like if there is space for a diplomatic solution it should be pursued. Any more bloodshead is horrible IMO. I hope Russia and Ukraine make peace already because this ...this is just terrible senceless violence.

6389,"We named a freshmen on the football team Ted. His name was Ethan, but we all just called him Ted because he looked like a Ted.

Fast forward to later in the season when all of the coaches have known him only as Ted for months, and he gets a shot to go play in garbage time during a varsity game. He goes in and the announcer with the roster sheet calls out that ""Number ##, Ethan ______ in at guard"" and the coaches looked around in confusion because they had no idea who Ethan was."

6422,"&gt; Almost every country in the world has a better healthcare system than the US. It's the lowest standard you can set.

Keep some perspective.  If you had a medical emergency or got cancer, would you really rather go to a typical hospital in Nigeria or Laos, or even Brazil or India?

The US system fares poorly for a developed country, mostly because of extreme inefficiency and lack of insurance coverage for everyone.  Still, even most very poor Americans still receive health care better than that of the majority of people on this planet.  

The majority of humans still don't have any access to what we'd consider to be modern medical care."

I don't know if he did the shooting or not. Something is up with his brother Eric as well. The bottom line is that people were attacked on purpose and nothing can ever make it different no matter what we find out. I followed this extremely close. Most of my information comes from Jake Morphonios over at Blackstone Intelligence on YouTube. He got so close he did figure it out, and has had a gag order placed on him. I think its obvious the people involved are trying to keep this covered up and they would prefer we forget it happened."

6447,"How does spending $2.5 million dollars to investigate foreign funding of groups campaigning against the Alberta oil industry benefit the Alberta oil industry? All the investigation is going to uncover is that environmental groups accept foreign money, which everybody already knows and isn't illegal. They aren't political groups who can be persecuted for accepting foreign financing. 

This is a waste of money if the goal is to actually support Alberta's oil industry. Kenney would be better off investing that $2.5 million in the industry itself and not trying to persecute its critics."
6448,"Honestly mages pushing marksmen out of botlane can be sorted by just reverting the buff they did ages ago which made champion who built AP do more damage to towers. Before the only mage who could really go bot and take towers was Ziggs (and he did see a bit of play in bot). Then they changed it so that AP scaled to do more damage to towers and now marksmen aren't necessary to take towers so don't have one niche that they were always required for.

Whether or not mages should be allowed in bot lane is a different debate, I personally like it as it does add diversity and I was never a fan of the marksman class, but each to their own on that one."
6449,"Not really. The Astro conspiracy is just commonplace PR businesses do when faced with an image problem. It was painfully transparent, and fell apart with the first light gust of wind.

6461,"If anything, I think Nakata is somewhat overrated because he is seen as a pioneer. In a way, racial biases and Serie A elitism of the era made Nakata a bigger name than his performance warranted. ""Oh my god, an Asian who doesn't get planked off the ball with a shoulder lean? Waow!""  
&amp;nbsp;  
Now, it's accepted that Asians can football. The world went from ""Wow, he's good for an Asian"" to ""Wow, he's good"" and that in turn means that expectations are higher, and it's a lot harder to impress. Nakata had a hand in making that so. But if Nakata played now, he'd probably be considered a regular good player, not an era defining one. On the other hand, he might be playing a lot more than he did, hypothetical scenarios and all."

&gt; Ngo has been building to a dramatic confrontation with the Portland far left for months, his star rising along with the severity of the encounters. “Hated by antifa,” Ngo’s Twitter biography read before and after the attack. Scary-looking antifa marchers glare from his account’s banner image. 

&gt; Ngo’s videos of angry leftists, along with his status as a local, got him back on Fox News. He first appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight on October 8, 2018, accompanied by his own footage, under the banner “Antifa Protestors Block Traffic In Portland.

6551,"Most of the blame goes on the defenseman. He even saw the player coming at him, clearly going for a big hit. But, he decided to keep the puck and to try and make the cute play of spinning off of the check last second. The is a play that the new-age, silky smooth defensemen (Girard, Hughes, etc.) are pulling off. That move wasn't even really an option here (he was already lined up, had nowhere to go). He should've gotten rid of the puck when he first saw the forechecker, or just braced himself for the big hit.
 

For the people that are going to say ""he didn't even go after the puck."" He didn’t go for the puck after the hit because his teammate was in a better position to keep the puck down low or put pressure on the other defenseman.
 

Sure, it's charging. But this shouldn't have been a suspension imo."

Yes but why are men under 25 charged more for insurance? Because they are more likely to engage in risk taking behaviour and thus more likely to crash.

It's a name given to a set of events, like how ""the Holocaust"" describes the set of events in late 30s early 40s Germany that involved rising anti-Semetism and eventually full on genocide.  They are both subjects that involve bad things and bigotry, but the name by itself is just a name used to describe the set of events, same as The New Deal or the Great Depression.  If I were to make my username ""TheSpanishInquisition"" that doesn't mean I support arresting and executing Protestants.  I understand that you are saying that these terms can and have been used in offensive contexts, but this isn't one of them.  Nothing about a name is about ""implications"".

As someone that's interested in microbiome research it's safe to say that we don't know shit about the microbiome but the more we find out about it the more we're like, ""oh fuck, that's definitely not good"".

Now in NJ, college cops are real cops, and have jurisdiction over the whole state, as some colleges have remote campii.  So bomb threats came up.  

The chief relayed a story that there was a string of bomb threats years eariler, that started on a Thursday(I think).  They cancelled classes, brought in the state bob squad, and checked the whole campus.  The next Thursday, it happened again, and they did the same thing.  This kept happening, and they were two weeks/days from it requiring the Thursday classes to all be cancelled, as they wouldn't have enough class hours to fulfill the requirements.  So they decided to ""ignore"" the threat the next time it came in, and nothing happened and the threats did not continue.

6740,"People aren't really giving you any good advice, they're basically just insulting you. So here's some advice:

Blitz hook is 20 seconds at rank 1. If he misses a hook he's a sitting duck. Presumably you're playing supp or adc? Put minions between you and Blitz. When he uses his hook he can't do anything for about 20 seconds. So just autoattack him and harass him. He can't grab you for 20 seconds so he can basically do nothing but run away.

Learn that a lot of the time when he use W it means he's going to rush you. If he pops it be prepared to back off. Without it, landing hooks is much harder.

Hopefully this helps. Just glance at the in-game timer after he hooks. You know that you have a 20 second window where he can basically do nothing but stay away from you."

I mean she literally has hundreds of examples of large sums of money changing hands from foundations (some affiliated with American petroleum producers no less) in the U.S to anti-oil and pipeline organizations in Canada.

6839,"My main criticism is in the lack of a supporting character to contrast with Roy (Brad Pitt). Roy personality made him very hard to symphysis with and would need good, focused writing to compensate for it, which the movie lacks virtue to, ironically, the main character's mind to the plot. The way they showed Roy's inners thoughts didn't help viewers to get more comfortable with him, instead, it ruined the chance to see a stoic character breakdown his mask as he showed more emotion thought out the journey.

An emotional, comedy relief character would make this movie at least 25% better. The sequence inside the spaceship with the captain who I forgot the name showed exactly this. His humorous attitude contrasted with Roy's, even when they didn't directly act with each other. Sadly, most of the time we are alone with Roy and his thoughts.

The most positive point they had made was the way humanity's greed took place in other planets/stars. It wasn't the utopia where most problems would be solved with technology but just new ways of getting more gains in business. If they made a somewhat criticism with this factor, especially with how subtle but present they made the ambients be, it would surprise the audience no doubts.

6908,"Lmao, ethnic cleansing? I mean, there were deportations of Lithuanians and Chechens during the WWII and great famine in Ukraine (as well as in Russia tbh), but in general, USSR consisted of like 15 “big” republics with kinda different nationalities across the board, and the Russian part consisted of about 20 smaller republics of Yakuts, Tatars of Bashkirs for example or Tannu Tuva. It's like national diversity was its power.

Now compare this to Americans who literally exterminated whole nations. Not even close. If Soviets are more atrocious than that, that should mean that Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, Kyrgyzs, Uzbeks, Turkmens, Tajiks, Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijans, Tuvans, Yakuts, Udmurts, Ossetes, Chechens, Dagestanians, Tatars, Kalmyks, Cherkesses, Karachaevs, Ingushes, Bashkirs, Mordvins, Mari, Evenks, Nenets, Karels and various others would be exterminated during the conquest, leaving the space for Russians only. But there are 186 native ethnic groups in Russia only, and Russians take up only 78.1%. How much natives left in the USA, again? 1%. Or 3M people.

I mean, nice try, but you really have to study history a bit."

6983,"&gt; what about the raid essence, the conquest essence, the M+ essence, the essence that requires Nazjatar bodyguard experience, etc?

All of those, with the exception of raids with obviously have weekly lock outs, allow you to farm what you want in a much more repeatable, and reliable, fashion. If you have the time to put in, you get the reward. Oscillators aren't like that at all. If you kill every rare spawning in Mechagon in any given day, that's it. Killing them does nothing a second time. So if you get nothing that day, you get nothing. If you have Real Life things to handle and can't do Mechagon that day, you're SoL. Unlike farming pvp or pve content where you can keep running content to get the drops, and if you miss a day it doesn't ""hurt"" as bad b/c you can do tons of dungeons the next day to ""make up for it"". There is no getting back a missed Oscillator day

Oscillators do not need to be as rare as they are. They could be added as drops to EP, or Operation Mechagon. Add an exchange rate for SPARE crates/coils to buy oscillators. Or have increased drop rates from rare mobs in Mechagon or chests in Mechagon. Or keep the drop rates the same but lower their cost for crafting/purchasing. There are so many routes they could go to for balancing it"

7118,"If we \*do\* get a world revamp, I hope that it's not just Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, but it also includes Northrend and Pandaria. If the world is being remade in that way, even if it is just Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, there should be plenty of world content in those zones for people to play with.   


""World"" quests should be actual world quests rather than ""zone"" quests. I remember the legion pre-launch event and I loved going into the world again to fight off demons. I loved seeing Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms and having to traverse the world.   


Let flying be a thing right from the get-go, but during certain events like a Black Empire invasion or any of their affiliated groups, make flying impossible by having the enemy control the skies until the player has been able to fight off the invasion. If you enter a zone flying, you're shot off your mount and you die.  


I think that the Dragon Isles should be more of a Najatar/Argus style ""continent"" which is pushed as a new content patch later in the expansion. Leveling from 120-130 (or, if we get the level crunch, whatever that will entail) should be done in the remade world. How? Well, if the Black Empire is unleashed, then the continents will be under siege.   


Have there be an actual war campaign for both the Horde and Alliance against the Black Empire for leveling. Have there be 3 campaigns to choose from at level 120, each one starting with the defense of a different capital city assigned to your faction. You're Horde, so you get to choose either to help with defending Silvermoon, Thunder Bluff or Orgrimmar first. Let's say you pick Silvermoon. You start off defending the city from a Black Empire invasion, and the players push forward out of Silvermoon into the Ghostlands, then progressing into the Eastern and Western plaguelands and Hinterlands. Start in Thunder Bluff, and you push into Southern Kalimdor. Start in Orgrimmar and you push into Northern Kalimdor. For Alliance, you start in either Stormwind, Ironforge or Exodar. Exodar sees the reclamation of Teldrassil, Darkshore/Felwood/Moonglade/Hyjal. Stormwind sees the reclamation of the Southern end of the Eastern Kingdoms, with Ironforge setting forth North in the Eastern Kingdoms.  


Now, for leveling between 1-100, don't have the black empire be a factor like Deathwing was during Cataclysm. Go back to just questing in the world, doing simpler tasks and dealing with local issues. Revamp the Worgen and Goblin leveling zones as well. Level 100-110, Legion. Level 110-120, Broken Isles.   


Also, can we just have everyone stop calling us ""champion""/""hero""/""savior""/""commander."" How about ""adventurer"" or something a just something a little less extravagant."

7136,"Still blows my mind that Canes backfield at one point was:

Portis, Gore, McGahee"
7137,"**Tank**

* Roadhog is the biggest counter to Doomfist by a mile, imo. 600 HP with self healing up to 300 HP makes you nearly impossible to kill as Doom. His hook along with his gun makes him even more devastating. 
* Orisa is also a great counter with her fortify making Doom unable to boop you around, and your pull can disrupt him and pull him into a tough location to escape. 
* A Zarya with solid bubble placement can make it nearly impossible for Doom to do lots of damage, and can be an easy way to feed her charge.
* D'VA can boost towards a diving Doom and boop him around, along with dealing lots of damage with her micro missiles. Her boost can also be used to escape a Doom dive if you happen to be his next target.

**Damage**

* I would say the biggest DPS counter is Pharah. Unless she flies low enough where Doom can do an epic rollout [like this](https://gfycat.com/highcleanfoal), Pharah is impossible to do anything to with Doom, besides shoot a cheap potshots at her.
* McCree's stun can freeze Doom during a dive and make him an easy target for a cheesy fan. His accurate high damage shots can also take a Doom down quickly due to his infamously large hitbox, if your aim is good enough.
* Genji also counters Doom just because he's so hard to kill with Doom. Genji can run up walls, double jump, dash away, and deflect any incoming shots.
* Reaper can wraith away from Doom dives, and if combined with CC, can wipe Doom off the map with a few shots from his shotguns into his giant hitbox.
* Ashe's buddy B.O.B. is a huge Doom counter if he locks onto him. No matter how fast Doom moves, B.O.B. won't miss a shot on him. Her coachgun can also boop Doom around the map and disrupt him.
* Mei counters just about everything with her freeze, iceblock, icewall, and ult.
* Torb's turret can affect Doom the same way as B.O.B. can, due to the turret never missing a shot. Torb's Overload can output tons of DPS while making it harder for Doom to kill you if you get dove by him.
* Bastion in turret form can delete Doom almost instantly, just like every other hero in the game.
* Junkrat can deal massive amount of damage to Doom during a dive so it's possible to kill him before he even kills you. His mines can also escape a diving Doom and deal damage to him.
* Tracer counters Doom the same way Genji counters him, in that she's so hard to kill as Doom unless you RP her into a wall. I've probably killed Tracer during a dive less than 3 times in 95 hours.

**Support**

* Ana is Doom's biggest counter mainly because of her sleep dart. If you land a sleep dart on a Doom, it's usually game over for him and an instant feed if he didn't get any picks beforehand. Her nade can heal you and/or teammates while giving Doom anti-heal, making it much easier to kill him or delay follow-up dives while Doom waits for the effect to go away and get heals.
* Moira and Mercy can both fade away from a diving Doom easily, but Mercy will need a teammate unlike Moira.
* Brig can stun Doom with shield bash, along with booping him around with her flail. 
* If Baptiste keeps his boots charged, he can leap up to avoid a diving Doom.
* Lucio follows the same philosophy as Genji and Tracer, as he can be nearly impossible to kill if you hug walls and keep wall bouncing everywhere.

Any hero I didn't list is because I think they don't provide a significant counter to Doom to be worth mentioning.

As for when you should pick him, I say it's after you don't get a kill after a couple of deaths, you find it too hard to get any picks because of a lot of Doom counters, or if the second DPS on your team is not ranged DPS. Someone like Sombra, Genji, Tracer, etc. Two close ranged DPS, with maybe an exception to a good Reaper, makes the DPS pretty low from what I've experienced. I would also swap if the other DPS is a Widow, as Widow outputs short bursts of DPS rather than a consistent stream of it, so stuff like shields or tanks will probably never die to a Doom/Widow combo."

The difference between their previous works and CC is tremendous. Slight animation issues and still frames aside I have no complaints about this series. I'm amazed they managed to do such a good series.

Latin American countries have census categories for peoples defined or self-defined as mestizo despite this not actually telling an in-depth racial story. That is because of the cultural dynamics present in their respective countries.

I don't even know where to start with this, but overall I am supremely happy with Youko becoming the assertive badass queen I always hoped she could be.

During the initial banishment of Koukan and cleaning out his support from the court, I had speculated that it was all a conspiracy but not one against Youko, and I guess I was right about all that with one big exception. I still don't quite know why the one woman who got riddled with arrows tried grabbing Youko as a hostage, as it made the whole assassination plot seem a lot more plausible at the time.

There's a lot of cleaning up in this with people thankfully following the queen's orders through all of it. Enho seems like a good choice to have around the palace as an advisor, even before he was known to be the legendary Roushou. And Kantai getting promoted to the head of the Royal Army is a great choice, who would dare attack when the leader of their forces is a *bear*? I definitely didn't make the connection between him and Baku though, even though in retrospect the hints are there.

And Youko's first declaration is an interesting one, I think something that could only be brought by someone that's an outsider to the whole system. The people native to the Twelve Kingdoms are too steeped in the culture to even see it as an option and even Kaikyaku from older ages like En-ou wouldn't think it unusual. But it makes sense as an ordinance from the modern era, even if it wasn't a deeply personal thing for Youko given that Asano's fate was tied into it.

A great ending to the arc though it was a bit drawn out in the earlier stages and a solid step forward for Youko in her journey as well. Looking forward to more of her ruling now and hopefully seeing Suzu and Shoukei return to the court before the end of the anime."

I remember seeing those signs across the city. I was quite touched by them, despite not being associated with either team. 

But using a ""A City United"" joke isn't the same as using #metoo as a joke because the various delicate and nuanced connotations between the both sets of victims and both sets of crimes. The bombing was a tragedy and everyone recognises it as such and the victims are memorialised in our grief. MeToo is something almost endemic that has millions of silent victims that are mocked, judged, are forced out of their jobs and a 1000 other things and the perpetrators of their crimes will walk among us, day in, day out.

Obviously MeToo has individuals and aspects that are far from infallible, but it's an open sore in society, and it's not surprising that it's being treated as such."

But the thing is, Riot has coded their game in a time where they didn't followed proper software development life cycle procedure, back when they were indie.

1500: ~9million

1618: ~17million

1650: ~10million

1700: ~14million

1750: ~17million

1800: ~21million

1871: ~41million

1914: ~66million

1918: ~65million

1939: ~69million (excluding Austria etc)

1945: ~66million

today: ~83million

it took German lands more than 100 years to recover the population loss from the 30 years wars. Pre 1871 ""data"" is for Kaiserreich borders excluding Alsace and Lorraine. There were some major population ""losses"" in 1919-1920 and 1945-1947 not only due to famine but also due to territorial losses.

Iirc the Cholera epidemics hit France more than German lands, though not by much. France had about 20million in 1500 and 20 million in 1700. It already had about 20 million since the 14th century so it really stagnated for quite some time."

In Canada, yes, they have 7 years of studies, because a bachelor's is required for entry into chiro school, but that firat degree could be in humanities, psychology or sciences. Ymmv in terms of clinical relevance, so I personally don't count 3 years of that education. Once admitted in chiro school, they spend 2 years studying preclinical sciences, which includes anatomy and physiology. That's relevant stuff, so I'm counting this.

Then one year of clinical studies. This includes how to take a patients history and perform diagnostics test. Important stuff, so now we're at 3 years, plus one year internship, also super important because experience teaches things books don't.

So we're at 4 years, not 7. They're only allowed to treat dysfunctions of the spine and joints through manual manipulation. For diagnostic purposes, they can requisition x rays and ultrasounds, but no MRIs or CAT scans. Chiros in Canada are pushing for more rights, but some of the members, including the college admins, recognize that in order for that to happen, they need to abandon their theory based origins and get on the scientific and evidence based methods, but that's creating a split among the members."

If there were journalists out there saying at the time ""hold on now I think all these major media outlets are being hasty accusing Jewell without proper evidence"" then they were in the vast minority and while they don't deserve to be vilified as much as those that did the actual reporting and editing there is such a thing as guilt by association; and argument that if you are part of a profession and that profession makes a massive mistake that you are unable or unwilling to correct then you share some of that failure."

7571,"Always loved this band. Just a bunch of really talented musicians who maybe butted heads / had creative differences toward the end but I can only attribute it to how much each person was such a force. 

&amp;#x200B;

Roger of course on the 12 string, who, if you thought you could pick up his generally simple arpeggios, had you changing your mind right around Fifth Dimension when he started emulating Coltrane lines on the guitar. The way he makes notes bleed and jumble into eachother drives me nuts. We all know Eight Miles High but I've always felt a lot of great tracks got cut from that album (again possibly diverging interests/intent). The [John Riley instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzbxCkAZNOo) which was cut ultimately is my favorite example of this. I believe it was a question of marketability, if the hot thing is folk rock and you made 2 albums of folk rock but want to get into 'raga rock' it's the age old problem of total creative freedom vs making sure you can keep your music career going. Remarkable album though, cut tracks considered.

&amp;#x200B;

I love David Crosby (ego and all) because of his high harmony parts. It's the perfect combination of the angelic timbre of his voice and something about the notes and intervals he harmonizes the melody on. He also sounds very comfortable singing as high as he his. I never hear him straining on the records. But, and Turn, Turn, Turn, may not be the best example, but he as a way of basically making himself the melody to my ears. When I listen to songs like [Mr. Tambourine Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYLKlgalHMs) or [Have you Seen Her Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25YxNSkLDB8), it's probably safe to say that the song was written with Roger's or Chris's lower vocal melody at first. Tambourine is Bob Dylan's so that's obvious, and HYSHF was written by Chris. But when David harmonizes, he lays claim to the melody to it seems. Hell, on HYSHF Chris's line sounds relatively simple and tends to move donward. But David's line is leaping up and down and steals the show in both the verses and choruses. Lovely song, hats off to Chris for it. But David does that byrds thing with his voice. David also wrote some cool songs for the band that were rejected. They're usually my favorites, but there was a lot of talent in that band so I get it. My favorite of his [Lady Friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldz-a3b4-cU) which received a single release but nothing else. Not sure who was responsible for the little guitar/brass interlude there but it blows me away.

&amp;#x200B;

And Gene who basically held up the band for 2 albums by being the principle songwriter. I remember reading that David owed a lot of his harmonies essentially because Gene tended to writes chords and melodies in a way that put him in a really good spot harmonically. I love Gene but I probably can't sing his praises as well as someone else. I'm more of a Chris/David guy as far as songwriting goes but I love Gene's songs, and they set the tone for the band and put them on the path to success.

&amp;#x200B;

And Chris! While David and Roger started writing songs for the band in Fifth Dimension, Chris absolutely exploded on Younger Than Yesterday. I mentioned HYSHF which is my favorite Chris track, so here's [Renaissance Faire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlsIfb4lo1c) which demonstrates to me how nuts he was on bass. Even while melodic bass like that was very in at the time as people like Paul McCartney and Brian Wilson were doing (amongst...basically everyone else), Chris's bass lines always felt fundamentally Chris to me.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I wanted to talk about The Byrds a lot. I love these guys from Mr. Tambourine Man to Notorious Byrd Brothers. I'll spin Sweetheart of the Rodeo or something if I'm feeling their more country or esoteric stuff which is admittedly rare. But what a wonderful band."

\&gt;I'll try to summarize: Train-obsessed photographer on 2ch's train board makes up the word ""barisaku"" for a specific way to get the lighting just right when photographing trains, and keeps spamming that phrase on 2ch so much he ends up getting nicknamed Barisaku-kun  
\&gt;Then KyoAni makes an anime about people who play in an orchestra (""Sound! Eufonium"") where they use the word ""barisaku"" as a short for ""bariton sakusofon"" (bariton saxophone), and he thinks they stole his word that he was so proud of.  
\&gt;What really broke the camel's back was when KyoAni collaborated with the Kyoto public transportation authorities to decorate a train with anime characters from Sound! Eufonium.  
\&gt;From then on he went to 2ch's/5ch's anime board every single day to shitpost about how KyoAni ruined his life.

7607,"That processor is probably what's holding you back; if I'm seeing the right model, you're rocking an entry level cpu from 2012.

Easiest way to boost your FPS would be to simply replace the CPU, so see if there might be a more recent/powerful cpu for your socket type (looks like FM2). If there isn't one, you might have to upgrade the whole thing except the GPU - the RX470 should be good for Overwatch.

If you can't afford to upgrade, make sure that your game is running the graphics through the RX470 as opposed to the on-board graphics on your CPU. You can usually disable the on-board graphics through your BIOS."

I don't think that Trump is a knowing puppet actually, but still believe he is an unknowing puppet. 100% willing and ready to be wrong and switch to knowing puppet, just my current thought process is all.

I think the original plan to divide America was Obama, but it didn't work out. Most of the time in my experience when the republicans loose, they may be upset but they don't throw a shit fit over it. I think TPTB thought they would over a black president, instead they mostly just gripped and waited it out. Not like the riots in Oregon and beatings at various voting polls we got when Trump was elected. 

So they switched plans, through Trump in there and boy-oh-boy did that work. There is a solid wall of hate between Americans right now. Most of my friends are republicans, some democrats. Every election prior to Trump/Hilary none of us every argued about each others political beliefs, but that election turned people in our group against each other in ways that shocked me.

So they will give him another 4 years to really drive it in. Best way to do this is the every-so-waited swamp draining. Throw a bunch of high profile democrats under the bus for the greater ""good"".

It's like with accusations of rape which are widely publicized and then shown to be false - it's true that these stories *both* provide victim-blamers with precedent to delegitimize future accusations, *and* put the onus on the news media for reporting before knowing the facts (and/or before the case is, ya know, actually fucking settled).

On the other hand, speaking as a ""member of a minority group"" (gay dude), I know for a fact that *lots* of people (particularly fellow gay dudes) do like ""playing the victim"" and get a bizarre sort of satisfaction from creating their own problems when none exist. It sucks, because there *is* plenty of systemic homophobia, just like there's plenty of systemic racism, but when you go looking for it in places where it's not, you're hurting *everyone.*

But the news media also has a responsibility to not feed these people's wannabe-victim complexes by picking up and spreading any news story that has to do with homophobia/racism/etc. We're living in a stupid era in which systemic prejudice is used for political and financial gain - news media companies get ""clout"" (and more importantly, clicks) for publicizing stories about prejudice, which encourages them to pick and choose these ""victim"" stories before any thorough vetting happens."

You also go for the bare minimum, let’s say 1 hour for 3 days a week. 

I see all these people really into the mood, the community, the martial art itself... and then there’s me, not excited about having to put my Haruhi rewatch on-hold and daydreaming about getting back home, laying down with some food, and continue to watch Kyon monologuing around and Haruhi being an asshole.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

&gt; Jim Croce (Jan 10, 1943 ‒ Sept 20, 1973) was an American singer-songwriter from South Philadelphia whose biggest single ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" hit number 1 on the US charts in the summer of 1973. His influences included Ian &amp; Sylvia, Gordon Lightfoot and Woody Guthrie. Sadly, Croce died in a small commercial plane crash one day before his third album, ""I Got a Name"" was to be released.

&gt; Early life

&gt; Croce was born in South Philadelphia. He graduated from Upper Darby High School in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania in 1960 where in 1976, he was the first former student to be added to the high school's Wall of Fame. Then, while attending Villanova University (1965 graduate), Croce became interested in becoming a professional musician and met his future wife, Ingrid, at a hootenanny at Convention Hall in Philadelphia, where he was a judge for the contest.

&gt; Early career

&gt; During the early 1960s, Croce formed a number of college bands and performed at coffee houses and universities, and later with his wife Ingrid as a duo in the mid-1960s to early 1970s. At first their performances included songs by Ian and Sylvia, Gordon Lightfoot, Joan Baez, and Woody Guthrie, but in time they began writing their own music, such as ""Age"", ""Hey Tomorrow"", and ""Spin, Spin Spin"" which later led to Croce's hit songs in the early seventies.

&gt; At the same time, Croce got his first long-term gig at a rural bar and steak house in Lima, Pennsylvania, called the Riddle Paddock. There, over the next few years, Croce developed a very engaging rapport with tough audiences and built his musical repertoire to over 3,000 songs. His set list included every genre from blues to country, rock 'n roll to folk, with tender love songs and traditional Bawdy Ballads, always introduced with a story and an impish grin.

&gt; In 1968, Jim and Ingrid Croce were encouraged to move to New York City to record their first album with Capitol Records. For the next two years, they drove over 300,000 miles playing small clubs and concerts on the college concert circuit promoting their album Jim &amp; Ingrid Croce.

&gt; Then, disillusioned by the music business and New York City, Croce sold all but one guitar to pay the rent, and they returned to the Pennsylvania countryside where Croce got a job driving trucks and doing construction to pay the bills. He called this his ""Character Development Period"" and spent a lot of his time sitting in the cab of a truck, composing songs about his buddies and the folks he enjoyed meeting at the local bars and truck stops.

&gt; Success

&gt; In 1970, Croce met classically trained pianist/guitarist, singer-songwriter Maury Muehleisen from Trenton, New Jersey. Initially, Croce backed Muehleisen on guitar at his gigs. But in time, their musical strengths led them each to new heights. Muehleisen's ethereal and inspired guitar leads became the perfect accompaniment to Croce's down-to-earth music.

&gt; In 1972, Croce signed to a three record deal with ABC Records releasing You Don't Mess Around with Jim and Life &amp; Times in the same year. The singles ""You Don't Mess Around with Jim"", ""Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels)"" and ""Time In A Bottle"" (written for his newborn son, A. J. Croce) helped the former album reach #1 on the charts in 1974. Croce's biggest single ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"", hit number 1 on the US charts in the summer of 1973, selling two million copies.

&gt; Sudden death

&gt; Croce, 30, and Muehleisen, 24, died in a small commercial plane crash on September 20, 1973 in Natchitoches, Louisiana one day before releasing his third ABC album, I Got a Name. The posthumous release included three hits, ""I Got A Name"", ""Workin' At The Car Wash Blues"" and ""I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song.""

&gt; Musical legacy

&gt; In 1990, Croce was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

&gt; In the late 1990s, Ingrid Croce, Croce's widow, and their son, A.J. Croce obtained the publishing rights for Croce's entire catalog of songs. Since then they have released Jim Croce Home Recordings, Facets, Jim Croce: Classic Hits, and the first-ever DVD of Jim's television performances on ""Have You Heard – Jim Croce Live"", with their most recent release in January 2006 of a CD of the same title. They also co-produced a PBS special, with archive footage from the Croce family collection, along with excerpts of their DVD Have You Heard – Jim Croce Live.

&gt; In 1985, Ingrid Croce opened ""Croce's Restaurant &amp; Jazz Bar"", located in the historic Gaslamp District in San Diego, California, partially as a tribute to her late husband.

&gt; Quotes

&gt; His personal motto: ""If you dig it, do it. If you really dig it, do it twice.""

&gt; On his roots: ""I never really thought of my neighborhood in South Philly as being a neighborhood, it was more a state of mind. For people who aren't familiar with those kind of places, it's a whole different thing. Like 42nd Street in New York City is a state of mind."" Read more on Last.fm.

Think the Epstein arrest was deliberately timed just before the Mueller hearing because Mueller was the Attorney General who ultimately was involved in Epstein's slap on the wrist in 2008 (even though the Media lied and put it all on Acosta), and Epstein was a ""confirmed"" informant for Mueller. 

Mueller is going to have to answer for lots of issues. There was the other case just last week where the judge shot down Mueller's claims that the Russian bots were tied to the Russian government, in addition to lots of other suspect issues with his phony report. But above all else, Mueller could very well have been a ""visitor"" on Lolita Island, and he doesn't want to go anywhere near that."

1. Wage suppression. Statscan put out a report that shows immigration contributes to suprressed wages, especially in professional/skilled jobs. Check it out if you're interested. It's pretty simple supply/demand.
2. Climate change. Living in Canada has a high environmental impact (long distances to travel, heating homes in the winter, etc). The more people living in Canada the harder it is to reduce our overall emissions. 
3. Housing prices. More people wanting to buy/rent = more demand = higher prices. Our housing proces are already absolutely insane. 

Being against immigration is in no way racist. Notice how none of my points mention race in any way? There are many legitimate reasons for wanting reduced immigration numbers."

7909,"Games with picks and bans have two critical differences than Overwatch: the other team doesn't have access to the heroes they pick and they don't allow swaps mid-match. Other games aren't completely reliant on team comp. Example; a ban on Rein is a ban on Zarya, a ban on Mercy is a ban on Pharah, etc. Then you have the issue of maps becoming completely imbalanced with certain bans. Like Gibraltar without a monkey, Horzion without a Lucio, Ruins without a Widow. And what happens if the game ever reaches a mostly balanced state? Bans then become disruptive to balance. Blizz just needs to change their methodology for balance, if everyone dislikes playing against a certain hero/comp, it needs to *change*\- not nerfed until it's unplayable, not banned, the game needs to change in a way that makes it tolerable. Overwatch is bleeding out and these band-aids will only keep it alive, not see it grow."

7918,"Worked at multiple vape shops in the past. We’d literally always have our mods on us. Anything we did we’d do while vaping. The exception was when we were mixing eliquid. That room was basically a dedicated no-vape zone because we wanted everything to be as clean and sterile as possible. But otherwise we’d be standing around vaping while selling stuff to customers (who would often be vaping too). It wasn’t encouraged but it wasn’t discouraged either. It just was. 

I’ll admit now that I have an actual job it’s weird to not just be vaping while working. I work in an office so I really only go outside a few times a day at most to vape while at work (once I’m in the car or at home it’s different though). A bit of a change but it’s easier to deal with than when I was smoking and needed to smoke a couple every 20 or 30 minutes."

7920,"Ah yes, ScreaM, the guy that has been playing for GamersLegion for the entirety of his career. Also i'd say that playing against somewhat bad team does not manifest in you being able to HS everyone because they just stand still and move like bots, but manifests in you having superior teamplay, gamesense and what not.

Movement (and aim) are two of the very core mechanics of the game, and something that doesnt differ as much in quality among pro teams as teamplay, strats etc do.

That being said it feels like we're reading too much into a single variable, and 66% is impressive either way. Just not as untouchable as you make it sound, i reckon."

7935,"While I agree with your comment in general, I have to chime in on this:

&gt; It’s hard to see your life’s work shit on so aggressively from people claiming to be fans.

People are criticizing the latest seasons (and season 8 in particular) *BECAUSE* they are fans, not *despite* that. They love the show and are massively disappointed with what was being done with it.

A fan isn't someone who loves the show / artist ""no matter what"". A fan isn't obligated to stick with a show, or the artist's music, after it's changed or gone downhill, simply because ""otherwise he isn't a fan"" or something."

7942,"Wut?!

Football absolutely has critical endurance aspects to it.  Sure, you need to go 'all out' for that 5-8 seconds that each play takes and should train yourself accordingly, but then you have to recover and do it all over again in between plays.

I played organized football (non-professional but very competitive) for 10 years, conditioning is KEY and guys definitely fade over the course of a game.  I know I felt it myself, you do your best during the play but ""all out"" changes a lot from the 1st quarter to the 4th.  Halftime is a good moment to catch your breath but it's still an extreme challenge.  Some guys in my league played offense + defense which boggles my mind.  I was a full-time wr/rb hybrid and a backup DB just to spell guys if they were gassed."

7958,"SR = Summoner's Rift. /Dev blog mentioned that both the login queue (obviously) and the game creation queues are shared resources. So TFT competes for the services that start an instance of a game, connect to all the players clients, load runes, champ data, etc.

&gt;  Note: There’ll be a Level 10 requirement for TFT on the first day and game starts will be throttled.

&gt; We’re doing a few things in all regions to help with the expected increase in server load.

&gt; Transfers are disabled until July 1st

&gt; Practice Tool is disabled

&gt; Custom modes are limited to 10 players minimum

https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hvzgE6om-tft-teamfight-tactics-release-timeline-and-temporary-restrictions 

So they are clearly worried about the load from starting tons of TFT and SR games in parallel.

This is an educated guess (I work on distributed payment systems) but some poor Senior Architect probably died on the hill of ""TFT and SR need to be independent infrastructure"", someone told him to take a hike - *OUR MARKETING MATERIALS ARE READY TO GOOOO, LAUNCH THIS THING* - , and his/her team slapped a load balancer on the queues and just increased the # of instances, and are now probably saying I told you so internally.

I'm willing to bet the smaller services called when a new game instance is created are failing under load / not designed with autoscaling in mind. Hence all the connection issues, remakes, etc this week."

(Hm the video sure is hard to find on google and YouTube) https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=9JjpG_1558575409

Like the next day he releases another video talking about Seth green and Hollywood pedos and specifically says he is not suicidal (common for people to say who believe they might soon be murdered “suicided”) 

Then a few days later he “comments suicide” by jumping off a bridge near or onto Route 66 and is hit by a car. 

Then same day Tom Hanks tweets weird “oh boy historic Route 66 road kill, I hope not”

A lot of my first point and a fair amount of my second also relies heavily on casting. Someone else pointed out down below that actors are tools and they're absolutely right.

I place a lot of blame on the devs.  I'm sure there are pressures from above, but someone looked at that HOA mechanic and signed off on it.  They had to approve of that shit and they thought it made the game better.  They had to approve of removing a shit ton of abilities from each class.  That was a decision they made to intentionally make the game less interesting.  Someone looked at the rep mounts for horde compared to all fucking horses for the alliance and they approved of that.

On one hand, yes, this person gave the green light for the studio to spend a lot of money on these films and they turned out great. That’s a necessary step in the process. 

Then again, they held the purse strings; they didn’t actually do the creative work. So thanking them *for the movie* and crediting them *for the movie* doesn’t exactly sit right, next to all of the people who actually did creative work on the film.

And how many great scripts did the studio *not* ok under his tenure? How many stinkers and duds were bankrolled instead?

I’m just always of two minds about celebrating studio heads as creative geniuses or more than a “necessary evil” (that’s harsher than I mean it to be) in the process of getting a movie made."

Violence consists of actions, words, attitudes, structures or systems that cause physical, psychological, social or environmental damage and/or prevent people from reaching their full human potential.

8162,"The natural THCA that cannabis produces is not psychoactive to humans.  But the THCA molecule is a carboxylic acid; it has a carboxyl group of atoms attached to it.  If you bake dried cannabis for a half hour at 250F/120C, the heat of your oven strips off that carboxyl group and then you're left with THC, which is psychoactive and ready to go.  

The process of stripping off that carboxyl group is called de-carboxyl-ation, and the finished cannabis is now decarboxylated.  

The THC will remain decarbed after that.  So yes, your ABV weed, already-been-vaped, can be consumed directly, no additional decarbing needed.

All weed, decarbed or not, declines in potency and quality over time.  This is primarily due to oxidation. You can retard oxidation by keeping your sealed ABV weed in the refrigerator or freezer."

One can say that at the time, due to the *translatio imperii* idea created by him and pope Leon III, the HRE was viewed more than a continuation of the original Roman Empire, which is confirmied in the chronicles of Frutolf of Michelsberg who included Charlemagne into the list of Roman emperors among Augustus and the others. At the beginning, the HRE was simply called by many as ""the empire"". *Sacrum Romanum Imperium* is the name thar appears for the first time in 1180, and though it was quite frequently used since the 13th century, it rarely appeared in the official documents. Nevertheless, we should rather regard Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor.

Fun fact: Charlemagne quickly dropped the *Imperator Romanorum* title conffered by Leo III. What seems to be the most plausible cause for this, is that he didn't want to provoke the Byzantine empire, which back then was still called Roman empire and still regarded itself as one. The title *forever Augustus* was being used by Holy Roman Emperors up until the Empire's dismantling in 1806."

Other than him, the whole cast is quite derivative mechanically.

Play Quake (1-3), Unreal Tournament (original), pretty much any MMORPG which has PvP, and pretty much any MOBA, and you'll quickly spot actions which have been duplicated in Overwatch."

&gt; there are obvious difficulties facing law enforcement trying to pursue prosecutions for offences committed abroad — as was highlighted by Abu Huzaifa case, where the New York Times revealed that a self-admitted ISIL executioner had returned to Canada undetected and has not been charged with any crimes (though he has since been questioned by the RCMP and CSIS)."
8307,"Is it me or live-action versions felt more dumbed-down than animation counterparts? Which is strange considering how people view animations as childish but these live-action movies are more childish than your regular family movies. This will be the sign that the society should stop viewing animations as an artistic medium for child audiences.

I mean, there has been a lot of great live-action movies based on fairy tales, don't get me wrong (see Jean Cocteau's take on Beauty and the Beast). But Disney's movies don't try to be unique or stand-out. Then again, Michael Eisener, the former CEO of Disney, don't want his entertainment to be his personal statement."

No it isn't. 

&gt;Bring them back and prosecute those that a case can be made against and then keep surveilance on them and use them like honey pots.

That is literally beyond the power of the government to do so. We don't have reports and testimonies of warcrimes. But it is impossible to pin anything besides their abandonment of Canada on them. Very  few have evidence to support their crimes; not all killers took video of them. And the witnesses and testimonies of the victims is in Syria/Iraq. So it would be better for them to try these criminals and execute them if need be. 

And, what if those criminals brought back go around radicalizing youth and other criminals into terrorism? That would be even worse for Canada. In Britain, this has already begun to happen."

Streaming is fine, but I've had it glitch and erase; lost a hard drive with 10000 songs once, just gone. Besides that there is always something you can't find, that disappears when the service loses the rights. Peter Gabriel, Prince, etc aren't available on my streamer, but don't want to pay for yet another or risk switching and losing my curated library.

I've never had it happen in practise, but in my training to be a cashier they mention what to do if various errors appear when someone tries to use a credit card, one of those steps sometimes being to ask for ID and see if it matches the card.

Ladder is a different story. GOATS isn't a problem on ladder because people want to play DPS. While the silvers on this sub might think locking 2/2/2 is a good idea in the long run it will just hurt the replayability of the game. And if you think someone on his DPS account will start filling for you when 2 DPS are already picked you're just being naive. Enter pistol only Mercy or solo flank Hog.

That is why Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church and created the Protestant Church of England. Protestant/Luther beliefs permitted divorce."

Such a list is created to make people like you believe that someone who speaks through facts, is actually part of some deep state program to manipulate the truth. 

Reality is, your base manipulates the truth, and targets those who display facts and the truth, as the guys in the wrong. 

You are a sitting example of how brainwashing works on people. You’ve been mislead to create a belief system that does not allow facts. 

And in the slight chance you ever come to this realization, which I’d really hope you do, you’ll see how your mind has been warped to create a new reality where the truth is the lie and the lie is the truth. In essence, you can have your perfect little world based of those delusions."

If I was in a front office and my very diverse team supported him, I don’t think I would have ended Haders career because of that myself.

8454,"I disagree. I think that deciding on some arbitrary amount of required knowledge for playing comp is meaningless. Picking prowess and flexibility is a skill just like aiming. A silver player will scoff at the picks of a bronze play, while a gold play scoffs at the picks of the silver player and so forth. Competitive is for doing the best you can. If the best you can do is making trash picks, then that's fine. 

That being said, smurfing obviously still sucks, and I don't think a bump to level 50 entry level would be unreasonable."

8463,"Yes and no. As an A's fan since early childhood, those teams and all the players from that era will always hold a special place in my heart. I still remember we had to make a rule when playing RBI Baseball '94, if I picked the A's, the opponent got to pick the National League Allstars to make it an even game.

Thats the Idea here. Rebuild of Evangelion is what happens when the fans got their wishes granted and Hideaki Anno just shows the outcome of it without any explanation.

Like the Children with the „curse of the evangelion“ are the hardcore fans, unable to move forward, stuck in time while everyone did mature eventually. 

Remember the Elevator Scene? Moments of nothing and in the original Rei the Puppet didn’t even react to Asukas slap. In the Rebuild they gave Rei more personality which forced an uncanny valley for a lot of viewers because thats not how deadpan Rei is supposed to operate. Especially not at that time."

(You can call him a jerk or an idiot, and  I wouldn't disagree, but I don't think he's really harming anyone.) If  the man starts pressuring the woman, that's a problem.

8562,"I'm currently a D4 Illaoi Main and I find the skill in her is really applying pressure post lane phase and getting a lead in the first place.

&amp;nbsp;

Illaoi is a very weird champion in that she can be good in team fights but the higher in elo you get, the better she is at splitpushing and skirmishes instead of team fights. Everyone always sees those big 1v5 plays done by Illaoi, but the truth is they're very far and few especially higher in the ladder you get. 

&amp;nbsp;

I completely agree she is frustrating to lane against but unfortunately that is just how her champion design is. She's designed to be a lane bully that can't push her lead as much due to having no engage and only one soft CC. Just like champions like Mordekaiser and Darius, laning against her can be a pain, but Illaoi is balanced as a champion even with her recent buffs.

&amp;nbsp;

She can be good at team fights but she's primarily good at being a counter engage in a team fight situation. Otherwise she functions as a split pusher and good skirmisher.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally as for the changes, the reason they were necessary is because in her pre 9.13 state her match ups were very coinflip literally because of dumb interactions relating to dots and tick rates. Match ups like singed, rumble and mordekaiser (who albeit is still a hard counter) just auto won trades purely because of the speed of their dot applications not because they necessarily out damaged you. Champions should be able to counter Illaoi because they out damage or have parts of her kit that lock her down or allow for outplays (i.e. kiting), not because their abilities are coded to have a really high tick rate and not much else. As a former Wukong main, his ultimate tick rate is stupidly low in general, but that shouldn't mean he has a lower chance to win against Illaoi. He should lose to Illaoi cause of the damage not the fact that his dot damage is applied less times per second than abilities.

&amp;nbsp;

The previous E interaction should only be justified if all dot affects have a similar tick rate or if the amount the cooldown of E is reduced by dots is significantly lower than other damage applications."

The scene where they remembered each other was beautifully done. I'm happy with how everything turned out, though I wish there were a few more chapters at the end (and possibly a spin-off with Kazu's brother).

Like he’s always throwing us a bone. Like we got 300 together last week between us and a few friends, figured we’d get 10 eighths because we pick between several kinds, he had 4 strains then. He gives us a break for 30 an eighth when he does everyone else 40, he knew we were getting it for some of her friends which hit him up too, it was just easier for them to give us the money since he couldn’t meet us till late let alone everyone, and he gave us an oz and a half anyways. We tried to tell him we were cool just with the ten, that was us getting a half for 80 but he insist on the oz and a half and we got 6 eighths instead of 4, for the price of 2. On top of throwing us a joint or two everytime and seeds when he finds some. 

He also recently just found shrooms and made sure they would be good and steady. And as long as we buy bud at the same time, we’re paying 25 an eighth for them, which is what he’s paying as well, just so people can get natural medicines or natural drugs, whatever their purpose for using it. 

I’m definitely blessed, my previous best guy was back in Ohio, one of my friends I grew up with, but even then, I’m paying 40 an eighth, like 220-300 an oz, for a handful of strains on the best of days. The first year in Missouri was rough, either 60 for bud that was mailed from Colorado, or 15 for some brickity brick that may have once been resembled weed, both were hard as hell to meet up with and hard to justify buying."

8695,"It should be obvious but that's just because Sona is the most mechanical champion. Let me tell you in case you are unfamiliar, Sona's Q hits not one but two targets. You think that's easy? You have to be IN RANGE OF ENEMY CHAMPIONS TO HIT THEM, AS SONA, which is the biggest risk in the world. Only Doublelift could handle that kind of play and succeed, consistently. And then of course when you press W you have to be in range of your own team. Have you ever thought about having to be in range of your team AND the enemy team at the SAME TIME? Talk about SCARY. But not for DOUBLELIFT. And then she has her ultimate, which doesn't do ANYTHING, except stun the enemies for 2 seconds or some shit. Fucking useless, but somehow DL manages to make it useful

FaZe need to cut the trash (olof, neo) and rebuild (coldzera pls somehow) but most importantly be patient - it took Astralis and Liquid several months to really warm up and start winning consistently too. 

Right now though, I'm very optimistic about mouz, I think they can be the #3 team in the world behind Liquid and Astralis until someone better comes along - they have the players, the leadership and motivation, definitely my favorite T1 team."

SOLVE that problem, and the money dries up.  There really is NO incentive for that outcome.

On a more cynical note, I see the same ""issue"" regarding abortion in the U.S.  In its current state **money flows freely** to BOTH sides.  Come to a workable compromise and the money disappears.  Ain't gonna happen."

Most older people usually comment on how they wished they could have had something like this and they're happy their kids (or grandkids) can have it. Beside older people who already have had kids also have their own targetted priviledges that other don't get to have. It's a give and take system.
Being opposed to it is like saying you don't plan to use the police or the firefighters so you don't want to pay for them or how disabled parking spot (and other disabled programs) shouldn't be a thing since I'm not disabled and cannot use them."

8753,The whole point of Quickplay is so matches aren't balanced and start quickly without waiting to get matched with players of the same skill. Also the badges mean nothing. there are some gold portrait players who are shit and then low level bronze badges that are amazing. If you want your experience.in qp to improve. Stop looking at the portraits until after the game is over. A lot of your issues are probably that you see the portraits and resign yourself to a loss before the game starts and then that ensures you do lose

Elitists United is pretty great but Veteran's analysis is often not very nuanced because he goes so hard on specifics, he probably could be nuanced since he is very knowledgeable though.

SI was always the best show, Monte both knew the game really well and was a great co-host that could actually banter back. LL is only fun because Thorin roasts Loco, not because of Locos direct contributions. Though I have to say hes become a better punching bag than he was a few years ago."

8794,"Really? can you not read a scene? holy fuck it's blatantly obvious. She attempts to proceed and the hound stops her, explains to her that Cersei is going to die regardless, and chances are she will also lose her life if she follows him.  There is no point for her to continue in her pointless revenge. It only harms her. 

She doesn't want to die, the castle is falling on her head, and she has that moment of enlightenment right there on the spot. She chooses to live, knowing Cersei is dead anyways. She leaves, and encounters mass destruction. 

You wanted her to what exactly? Die up there? Or then kill Cersei and then stay with Sansa in the north? OKK?? That's no better than her deciding to go west. If anything, it's a better ending for her to go on a new path. She was never going to be a ruler, she was never going to be content sitting still, this has been her character since the fucking beginning lol she was different than Sansa. She didn't want to be a princess. 

So, her revenge arc is over, she's freed of it, and is now going to explore and do something for herself. Like most people of that age tend to do lol except for fucking loser basement dwellers that can't leave home and therefore can't relate to that at all."

For me winston is the only main tank i can play without a healer and have abig impact on the game which a main tank should of course. 5 dps and a smart winston in gold and below is better than you give it credit for."

8855,"Yeah, this is just how game development works. You do your best to minimize scope because there's always too much of it. And part of that is by reusing as much existing code and assets as you possibly can.

Plus, this visual indicator pet looks pretty great on its own, so I don't see why it should be an issue."
8856,"A return to normalcy so to speak. Eliminate sharding and merge low pop realms into larger ones, give PvP it's own progression and vendors again, level squish because 120 levels where you go 40 levels at one point without ever receiving anything new is tedious and unrewarding, more old world content - give people a reason to travel outside of the main city hubs and visit lower level zones at a higher level so the game doesn't feel dead except for main cities, make normal mobs and quests more difficult so you aren't this invincible unstoppable killing machine like you are now, re introduce professions into the meta game and give then an important role throughout the entirety of the game not just end game content, a revamp of the entire world to suit the modern story so you don't feel entirely out of date every time you make a new character, remove Looking For Raid, make factions and classes unique again (i.e a certain class only one faction has, or subclasses for specific races on each faction, and make it so not every class gets everything i.e a heal, an execute, a mobility ability, etc) make more diverse end game content so raiding isn't the be all end all for the game.

Keep in mind that China (despite having 12x more people) only surpassed Japan in 2011 economically. And they needed the low-end manufacturing work to move out of Japan, Taiwan and SK and into China."

&gt; Blind Faith were an English blues-rock band that comprised Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood and Ric (aka Rick) Grech. The band, which was one of the first ""super-groups"", released their only album, Blind Faith, in August 1969.

&gt; Blind Faith formed in London, England, in late 1968 when Eric Clapton (ex-Cream) and Steve Winwood (ex-Traffic) were at loose ends following the demise of their former bands and began to spend time together again, jamming and working on new material at Clapton's house in Surrey (they had previously collaborated on a Clapton project called Eric Clapton &amp; The Powerhouse. At Winwood's instigation, Cream's former drummer Ginger Baker was invited along, and they subsequently spent some time recording in the studio. Rick Grech, bassist with Family, was invited to join them...and he left Family, mid-tour!  Record producer Jimmy Miller came in to bring some focus to the recording of further material.

&gt; News of the formation of the group created a buzz of excitement among the public, and a free concert was scheduled for London's Hyde Park on June 7, 1969. Their small repertoire was reported by the music press as having disappointed the crowd of 100,000 who were also expecting to hear songs from the days of Cream and Traffic. The recording of their album continued; followed by a short tour of Scandinavia, then a U.S. tour from July 11 (Newport) to August 24 (Hawaii), supported by Free and Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends.

&gt; Audience reaction in the USA was similar to that in the UK, and the band was forced to appease them by playing a couple of Cream and Traffic songs. The management pressure to cash in on the hyperbole (the Press dubbed them a supergroup), and Baker's view that the group was a continuation of Cream soured feelings within the band, and they disbanded immediately after completing the U.S. tour.

&gt; An expanded, deluxe edition of the album was released in 2001, with previously unreleased tracks and jams included. Two live tracks from the Hyde Park concert, ""Sleeping in the Ground"" by Sam Myers and the Rolling Stones song ""Under My Thumb"" are also available on Winwood's 4-CD retrospective The Finer Things.

&gt; The band dissolved in 1969 after only a year together. Winwood reformed Traffic, and later, a solo career. Clapton stepped out of the spotlight, first to sit in with the Plastic Ono Band, and then to tour as a sideman for Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends.

&gt; Upon its release, Blind Faith topped Billboard's Pop Albums chart in America (as it did the UK charts) and peaked at #40 on the Black Albums chart, an impressive feat for a British rock quartet.

I've never heard any of this, but it does oddly fit a lot of her known history. There's a lot of shadiness surrounding her already though. She's done a decent amount of shit that's well known in Minnesota to prove shes not trustworthy. There's been several situations that were exposed where she was misusing her campaign money. She was accused of using some of it for personal travel expenses and her divorce. She also was accepting money for speaking places, and that's not allowed. When people started bringing it up, she called them islamaphobic. She ended up having to pay some of it back, although I'm not sure which portions or how much, but obviously she was doing some of it. I still occasionally see local news articles mentioning the controversy on if she actually married her brother for citizenship or not. It was all over our local news stations, and even democrats here generally don't support her. She wasn't elected to skim monry, and we know she did. I generally don't hear or read anything good about her locally, but she seems to be put on a pedistal elsewhere."

It would have the effect of confusing viewers into believing a real controversy exists over certain issues, when it's really just a fringe group slinging bullshit against the informed consensus. By giving them a platform as ""fair time"", they gain legitimacy. It does damage. It's best to leave these people delegated to their safe spaces, letting them get banned eventually or whatever.

9016,"If Kawhi keeps struggling and the Lakers win, Skip Bayless' head will explode."
9017,"Connecting the dots, here is my theory. Sylvanas and Ashvane were working with Azshara this whole time, or at least cooperating with her. Sylvanas gets a hold of the evil void knife and Nathanos is seen with it in the introductory cutscene. He only says he wants the player, Lor'themar, and Thalyssra to go on an important secret mission without giving any details whatsoever. Nathanos is very specifically looking at the dagger right when Azshara brings the ocean down. This way Sylvanas gets rid of the three people who are a thorn in her side in a way that can't really be traced back to her and she destroys the Alliance fleet in the process. Her meeting with Ashvane was presumably her getting in connection with Azshara to set up these events. I'm presuming Ashvane has been in league with Azshara for a long time since she summons sea monsters during the Siege of Boralus dungeon. Ergo, Ashvane is in Nazjatar becuase she's acting as a go between for Sylvanas and Azshara, the former wanting to get rid of those she deems potential threats and the latter getting the Heart of Azeroth wielder down there to release N'zoth.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of other quick notes. Frist, Thalyssra and Lor'themar have been showing discontent with her decisions. Sylvanas, being paranoid as she is, wanted to get rid of them. Second, remember how quickly Nathanos gets the fuck out of there. We see him at the very beginning and then nothing anymore. He's in on it but wants to get out of dodge."

""Yep, it's like the old EPL system. The first team picks three maps &amp; ranks them from the one they want to play most to the one they want to play least. Then, without knowing which three maps have been picked, the second team bans two maps that they don't want to play &amp; the highest rated map left from the first team will be played. The second Bo1 is the same just the other way around.""

""Example: Team 1 picks Nuke, Train &amp; Mirage, Team 2 bans Nuke &amp; Dust II, so Train will be played as Nuke has been banned &amp; Team 2 rated Train as their second favorite map. I hope I explained it understandably."""

Considering the evidence they’ll likely show, that probably won’t work.

The US thinks burning that bridge will hurt CCP, but it will ultimately make Hong Kong less important, and eventually useless.

A always sounds like ""ah""
E always sounds like ""eh""
I always sounds like ""ee""
O always sounds like ""oh""
U always sounds like ""oo"" and is usually under-emphasized unless it's the only vowel in the word. 
Y is always a consonant (ya, yi, yu, ye, yo).
Most importantly, every vowel or vowel-consonant combo is always its own syllable. 
N is an exception because it can either be part of a vowel-consonant combo (na, ni, nu, ne, no) or be a consonant on its own. (""Honto"" would be pronounced as ""Hoh-n-toh"" and not ""Hon-toh"" for example.)

Your god, Your UNCHANGING and OMNIPOTENT god.  

Yes, our cultures have changed.  Did your god change?  Your perfect god changed?  To what?  More perfect?

Why does the bible treat women like chattel?  Like property?  Where are the commandments that protect women?

If a rapist was caught, he had to pay 50 shekels.

If a woman was raped in the city, she was executed because she should have screamed louder.

Truly a loving god.

Was your god wrong then?  or did your perfect god change?
If your god could say thou shalt not kill, your god could say thou shalt not rape.  But that didn't happen and you know it.

Instead of giving a price tag, why not forbid the act?  Was god wrong?  

But your god specifically said rape was ok.  
Moses ordered rape and genocide, under orders from god.

Slavery was permitted in your good book.  The rules for taking slaves and owning slaves were given.  And what did your loving jesus say about slavery?  Slaves obey your masters.

Truly a loving god.

You are giving the textbook apologetic answers to legitimate questions.  None of them stand up to scrutiny.

You keep going but you're barely making progress now. Seems like maybe you've still got this when Sha goo erupts from the floor and mantid and Sha start funneling out en masse and N'Zoth comments on how even in death Y'Shaarj is formidable

Things aren't good, you're getting overrun, but then suddenly your faction heroes show up to help and it seems like maybe you can salvage this.

Then suddenly tentacles burst in, dropping massive nerubians in giant saronite armor. And Yogg Saron addresses you. ""The mortals who shattered mymind in Ulduar, I'll enjoy repaying you in kind"" but then the other faction shows up ready to help. All right you're thinking, last stand of Azeroth, we can do this, we've fought a Titan, this can work. C'thun is stuck under Sargeras sword, it's not like he can come help of he's even alive

And then more tentacles, and silithid swarm the room, like blotting out the walls and ceiling. But these aren't normal silithid. No, they're azerite infused, as are C'thun's tentacles. Getting stabbed by a Titan sword might not be fun for an old god but an infusion of Titan blood sure does a body good. 

And yeah you're done, cinematic is a first person perspective of you cornered with an army of bugs about to rip you apart, knowing that you failed hard. Khadgar appears and opens a portal to escape through and sends you hurtling through but as he is about to follow you tentacles envelope him and just as the portal closes his eyes go black."

9326,"I was 14 at the time. I seen my grandma die in the hospital after a long battle with emphysema. My entire family was gathered around her in her last moments. Though, she wasn't aware of what was going on. She was heavily medicated. The strange thing is, everyone else was crying, except for me. It's not that I didn't care. The way I viewed it was, that her battle with emphysema was finally over. She didn't have to suffer anymore. Her last few years were a real struggle. So I was just glad that she didn't have to struggle anymore and could finally find a sense of peace. Sometimes letting a loved one go, is much easier than keeping them alive, and allowing their pain to continue. If that makes sense. It was much more merciful for her to pass away. That how I perceived the situation. 

Really, the saddest part of the whole ordeal, was watching how my family reacted. They were all so heartbroken. Especially my dad. I felt really bad for him. Even though I didn't cry in the hospital, I did eventually shed a few tears later on that night. Though, I didn't necessarily cry because of my grandma passing away. I cried because of how depressing the situation was. And also, that was just a really dark time in my life as well. The death of my grandma just made matters all the more depressing."

As I scrolled thorugh I stumbled upon Ezreal and his info on the stat page highlighted how all his skills are skillshots, which is why he is the most difficult champion yet to play. The ambitous teenager that I was, I grinded the 6.3k IP without buying any other champion to get straight to Ezreal. Continued playing him since then in every season and in any iteration, AP and AD. He is definitely my most played champion.

What's funny is how he used to be the most difficult, while now he is considered quite easy and hitting skillshots is expected. As life caught up to me, I kept having less and less time to learn new champs and stay truly competetive. Champs like Kled and Camille still seem very new amd complicated to me. While I I recently played Ez every chance I had, most other champs are mechanically and conceptionally too much for me, which is why I cherish picks like Garen, Morg, Singed and Illaoi that are pretty straightforward."

[(VIDEO VERSION if you don't feel like reading and would rather listen)](https://youtu.be/Op4Yrl2Ot7M) 
 
(The math starts a few paragraphs down if you want to get right to it)

The pacing of Game of Thrones has always been unique as far as television series go. It is a character-driven drama. Yes, there are battles, there’s sex, there’s violence, there are big flashy explosions and dragons and all kinds of things that you’d expect to see on a popular TV show in this day and age, but despite all of these flashy traditional television type moments, big wow visuals, scenes that get your heart racing and have you sitting on the edge of your seat, most of Game of Thrones is a couple of people talking to each other in a room. Or maybe outside. It’s really that simple. And it’s what makes Game of Thrones so special.

Characters drive the story and the pacing, the slow pacing specifically, allows us to get to know the characters on a level much deeper than we usually would get on a television show of this type. We learn everything about them: their hopes, dreams, fears, ambitions, political views, ideals, etc. unless of course the characters is purposely set up to be a mystery. 
We also see complex relationships develop, something that can only feel genuine and true when given the proper time to grow.

Game of Thrones has historically been a master of pacing and up until recent seasons never shied away from taking the slow route. 

We’ve been taught to expect a certain pace of character, relationship, and plot development just through watching the series. For better or for worse, we know how long it takes for things to happen in the world of Game of Thrones.  when suddenly they change the way they’ve been telling the story for almost a decade and begin to speed up the pacing by a pretty significant amount, there is no other reaction the audience could have then to feel that the story is being rushed, because it is being rushed by the standards set by the showrunners themselves in the first six seasons.

It’s a pretty basic concept but not one the showrunners seem to have considered. It’s also pretty easy to understand why rushing the end of an epic decade long story might be upsetting for an audience.  Especially for a story so full of complex characters, Easter eggs, intertwining plots, and prophecies.
We can look to a traditional three-act narrative structure for some clarity on this issue.  We get the setup, the background, the initial world building and character development in act one, we get confrontation, rising action, increased stakes, in act two, and in act three We get the crisis or climax and the denouement or resolution.  These three acts are traditionally of a similar length, with the second act often being the longest.  Where would we place the 8 seasons of game of thrones on a traditional narrative story arc?

*math starts here*

Here’s how I would break it down. The first act of this show is VERY long by television standards.  I would say the red wedding in the ninth episode of season 3 is the climax of act one and represents the transition from act one into act two. That means act one occurs over 26 and a half hours of screen time. Act two builds with obstacles and ascending action reaching a big twist in the middle:  I would say the death of Hodor fits well here.  That implies that the mid point of act two occurs in episode 5 of season 6.  That’s 23.7 hours from the beginning of act two to the midpoint of act two.  By traditional narrative storytelling standards, we could expect it to take another 24 hours or so to reach the climax of act two and enter act three.  

The way the show runners built the story (in the tv show) we have the long night, the battle of Winterfell, as the climax of act two, pushing us into the final build and the ultimate climax in act three of the battle of kings landing and the following resolution. But here lies the problem:  They only took 15 hours to get us from the mid point of act two to the climax of act two.  That’s only 63% of the length it should have been to feel natural and unrushed to us, the audience, based on the pacing they themselves set in the early seasons.  And what about act three?  (Which should generally be about as long as act one.)  From the aftermath of the act two climax, the battle of winterfell, to the last moment of the last episode, we only get 4 hours.  That’s only 15% of the length is should have ideally been, if they were following their own standard of pacing.  This is why the end of the show feels so incredibly rushed.  The denouement occurs in only 80 minutes.  That’s only 1.7% of the total screen time of this series.  Considering how many loose ends we have to wrap  up, this was laughably insufficient.

Not all television shows require this many hours to conclude the story in a satisfying way, but when you set an expectation over 10 years that the pacing of this show, that this world, moves at a glacial pace by tv show standards, the lack of consistency in pacing in the climax and conclusion is going to feel rushed. Take away the slow paced character-driven storytelling of Game of Thrones and you’re left with something that feels an awful lot like shoddily thrown together fanfiction."

Also the object that's dropped may have kept some downward momentum from the hop as it fell off, resulting in a faster fall.

9441,"I don't think they will stage an attack.  In order to engrain the narrative that ETI is a threat to humanity, the only things that really need to be done are:


-  Indoctrinate the public using fictional media

-  Control the mainstream narrative, and associate UFO's with ""threat"" (i.e. AATIP which stands for Advanced Aerial *Threat* Identification Program)

-  Get some loony celebrities to claim insider knowledge, and surround that person with a group of insiders all saying that aliens are a threat



The above three have already been achieved, now it's all about narrative control.  There's absolutely no competition in regards to people saying ETI is ""not"" a threat, because in truth nobody knows outside of those who control the narrative.  We can speculate all we want, and from one stance it doesn't seem very likely that ETI would travel all this way just to threaten us or wipe us out.  



When they feel that the public is ready, I believe they will stage an encounter with an extraterrestrial vehicle, one that they probably produced or possibly captured; I lean towards the former.  They will make wild claims that this encounter was solid proof that ET is here to attack us, and showed no regards for human life.  But the event itself, I am conjecturing, will be quick and it will be mysterious.  The ""aliens,"" as they want us to believe, will probably collide with a spaceship/satellite/vessel of human origin, and either wreck into it or maybe the human vessel will fire at it, and the ET craft will ""defend itself.""  This is probably how it's going to go down.  I never believed they would attempt to fake a full-scale invasion as there's way too many moving parts to make sure don't fall out of line.  It'll be a one-time event, and the discussion for globalization and the further militarization of space will be the end-result."

9504,"Playing support can feel hopeless if you have a bad team comp, like 5 DPS as you said.

However in balanced teams, I’ve found that healers have more carry potential than other roles. You have a lot of sway and power over how a match goes. Healers often have high impact abilities that can win a fight. Being able to keep your teammates alive in high pressure situations is big. Finding your other carries to pocket and combo with them. And quite a few healers have potential to get picks on top of doing damage. So healers can do a lot when played optimally. Especially when looking at players like ML7.

9526,"&gt; You say they aren't then say they are.

I describe their modified Titan forms as mindless monsters and then refer to their natural Titan forms as ""their Titan form."" Don't put words in my mouth, the difference between ""natural"" Eldians and what the Nazi stand-ins turn them into is very important. In all the lore we get concerning Eldians they live relatively normally, using their Titan powers as a utility and later a weapon. However, they are not mindless beasts, they only become that because of the Nazis (I'm just gonna call them that from now on) to make it easier). So the show isn't saying they're monsters, it's saying they're people that are different that are being demonized and discriminated against by another race of people. The mindless Titans they get turned into are direct result of the Nazis and are an analogy to how real life Nazis demonized Jews.

It's up to you to decide that Eldians are monsters. I think there's a strong case to say that Eldians are just different people and that they are being descrimnated against by the Nazis. It's an exaggerated way to show how people being different in a capacity leads to them facing discrimination. I don't think Eldians are monsters, I think they're just different.

To your last point, I think that'd be fine if handled well. It would be a very on-the-nose way of pointing out racism and drawing context the real world in terms of slurs. I'm sure there are many pitfalls a writer could fall into that would make it insensitive, but as a base concept it could be pulled off. The idea itself is not inherently bad.

Again, the WW2 themes SnK draws on are all metaphors and allegories. You're reading so hard into a show with literal sharp shape-shifting people in it. It's fiction, simply drawing inspiration and themes from our world. Stop looking to be offended. Hell, the allegorical Jews are the heros in this story, fighting for justice in the world. The Nazis are clearly villains and act unethically. This isn't antisemitic in the slightest."

Malfurion is someone who could throw Azshara off her game, ignite the barely contained rage and contempt she has for basically everything. Not to mention it would be an opportunity for Malfurion to come face to face with all the death he caused. Think the Jaina cinematic where she’s taunted by the ghosts of her past but now it’s an entire city. 

Tyrande has lived her whole life post Sundering with the fear of becoming Azshara. Now she stands at the crossroads. Her people have just been dealt a near fatal blow. Thousands dead and Tyrande feels responsible. But she doesn’t get to grieve, she can’t. She has to be strong for the scared, confused people who survived. She has to rebuild which is something she’s done before except that society got destroyed. Azshara has been in a remarkably similar position (albeit with a different perspective on things) or having to rebuild a society after great change. Tyrande could confront her fear, let go of her guilt and realize that she’ll never be Azshara and be the leader her people need."

9597,"&gt; Not sure what Liquid playing only 12 maps have anything to do with this

Take Jerry Rice for example. He is widely regarded as one of, if not, the best wide receivers to ever play in the NFL. His stats are compared to Calvin Johnson's stats, but everyone forgets to take into account the fact that the averages achieved by Jerry were done over a period of 19 years whereas Johnson's stats were achieved over a period of 8 years. You can't say ""Johnson was every bit as good as Rice"" when the career length for Rice is nearly double that of Johnson's (not to mention nearly 3x as many games played). To simply say ""Well, they both played at the top level but Johnson averaged a career record of 86 yards/game whereas Rice only achieved 75.6 yards/game. Therefore Johnson is clearly the superior receiver based off of this!"" 

It's extremely disingenuous to use an average to determine MVP based off of someone with a higher average over less of a sample size. There's a reason why there's a minimum for averages in (almost) every single professional league; you don't want someone making 1 100 yard catch in the one game they played having an ""average"" of 100 yards/game over the course of their career and thereby skewing the metrics. 

Should we use the rating as a guide when making these decisions? Absolutely. 

Do I think we should weigh in the fact that if ZywOo wasn't in Vitality for this event that they wouldn't have made it to the finals? Definitely. 

Should we also take into account the fact that he went absolutely mental and not only would Vitality likely have not qualified for this event but that they likely would have crashed out had they even made it? Without a doubt.

You can't say that even though the individuals in TL all showed up to the tournament and played extremely well that if one of them failed to achieve their maximum that Liquid definitely would have lost. You certainly can claim its mirror though - Vitality were extremely reliant upon ZywOo to carry them through this event and his MVP is a reflection of that given how much they achieved."

I like the idea though, and I know some ferries are trying to convert or experiment with hydrogen propulsion. There is also the issue of safety (which is why you see no ships driven by gasoline for example).

Unfortunately I think global shipping will turn to LPG/LNG first, as it will be an cheaper option, and demands no major refit of the engines."

Confirmation bias aside, as the reporters backing this story are from NY and one was even banned from MMP for fabricating stories......

The narrative the SI journalist was trying to push was very clear. Taubman wasnt targeting female journalists, and he wasnt targeting female journalists wearing a domestic survivors suppot wristband. He was celebrating as people do after they win a series like this. He wasnt taunting anyone over Osunas domestic abuse. I dont care if Osuna almost blew the game its not good for a players morale to be told they sucked rather than be celebrated heading into the WS."

The fact that the firm primarily practices personal injury law and solicits those cases does not mean that they are actually incompetent to take a discrimination case.  They could be competent, but just not as good as a lawyer that actually practices human rights law regularly (being just 'okay' isn't incompetence).  Lawyers can also consult with each other and other firms as long as there's no conflict and the client consents if the lawyer is outside the firm/association, so that could be happening."

It felt like two very different movies. We got one long close up of the Joker with drawn out scenes where I'm imagining the script just says ""Joaquin Phoenix acting.""

For example, the fact that his neighbor ""girlfriend"" never once hung out with him.

So I honestly took the Murray scene as it just in Joker's head, like his twisted narcissistic fantasy of him showing everyone why he does what he does. 

What I think happened in reality is that after the train scene with the two cops being beat up, he found himself in the middle of the mob and probably got in a huge fight and possibly killing someone. Then, subsequently gets arrested where he then is in the cop car that is then t-boned because it is in fact a ""cop"" car, only for the drivers to see there is a fellow clown in the back seat."

9818,"&gt;I honestly have no idea how blind someone has to be to miss a message that's even stated by the characters themselves. 

I haven't missed the message of the story at all if you actually think about what I am saying. The story is very pro-unity and equality and all things good. Fantastic, I am not at all faulting it on that front. As I have said over and over and over again is that the story accidentally stumbles into an awkward area without really realising the consequences of what it is saying. It is possible to have the intentional message and the unintentional message at the same time.

&gt;That's still too much of a stretch. Titans eat people and so that makes it a reference

It isn't a reference, I never said it was. Just like how nothing (outside of the arm-bands, Ghettos, and Madagascar plan) that I've mentioned is an intentional reference. What I said was that this yet another thing that accidentally plays into anti-Semitic stereotypes.

&gt;I really don't understand how you could possibly see a connection beyond just the cannibalism.

You quote me and then ignore the ""but general accusations of greater cannibalism were not uncommon"" part...

&gt;The fact that you're jumping through countless hoops to try to explain how this series is saying ""Jews iz bad people"" tells me otherwise.

How is that jumping through hoops? Just like the titans we have accidentally play into Jewish stereotypes I am suggesting how they would have to be altered to play into black stereotypes.

&gt;Again, I think the problem is that your mind sees it that way when the story is blatantly showing the opposite.

Again, I think you are missing the fact that the world isn't black or white. A show can say two different things in different parts, especially if one of those messages is unintentional. Very few if any works of art have a singular and all encompassing message. I can mean well by saying something but accidentally be racist, this isn't some sort of alien idea is it?"

&gt; R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, that was formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—""Radio Free Europe""—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single ""The One I Love"". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.

&gt; By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.

&gt; In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time.[7] In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.  Read more on Last.fm.

Think about what this would mean in practice.  We know that there are like 10 times as many players who prefer DPS as there are players that prefer Tank and Healer.  

Tank and Healer players would gravitate towards queuing for those specific roles for the instant matchmaking.  DPS queues would be long, so those players would gravitate towards queuing as Flex until those queue times reach an equilibrium.  

The end result is that you wind up with 4 DPS players in every match.  

&gt; ability to queue in 2 different slots

Kinda the same issue with role imbalance.  Queuing as DPS/Tank would put you in a game as Tank 9 times out of 10.  Unless you mean being able to queue as two roles and switch between them during a game, in which case that defeats the purpose of role queue."

What Ronaldo hsa done with diffrent teams is impressive but they were hardly push over teams. He always played for a team that was already a top 5 team in the world when he joined. All those teams were also closest to if not THE biggest teams in their respective league in the leagues history ( I don't know about United if it is seen as the biggest Prem club in history)."

As a bailiff told me, most of the time the defendants insist on a jury trial until they walk in the building and see a bunch of normal people, then they get scared and take the plea bargain. Hang out, try to get some work done, or read, or chat with your neighbor, and try to pass the time. Most days they let you go after 3 PM.

10383,"Not sure if OP is for real, wanting to use lethal force/molotovs and beat anyone not wearing black in Yuen Long... That would be a huge escalation of violence that will only hurt their own image, and no, rubber bullets and tear gas are not lethal forces no matter how you spin it.
Also isn’t one of the protester already arrested by the police for having explosives/molotovs 1-2 weeks ago?

Anyways from my understanding what happened in Yuen Long may have been organized by triads (the white shirts) but those people are also the locals (it’s a poor/sketchy district). They are the angry mobs that didn’t want the protesters to fuck up their district and chased them to the train station in Yuen Long. Maybe the anti-extradition bill protesters shouldn’t go there? I mean it’s their own turf...

And maybe next time you shouldn’t attack them in Yuen Long?

2, you are right that the money they have spent has not helped the club at all. That is one of the strongest arguments against them, since they hired Woodward, assess his performance, approve his plans, and three of the family get quite involved in the decision making process. So they are hugely to blame for that money being mostly wasted."

10427,"I’m glad your giving it a chance but honestly imo I liked kny since the beginning of the manga. The story was never boring and I personally loved the art style since the beginning and it only gets better as the manga goes on. Maybe it’s just me but I never really get sick of reading the many tropes in shonen people call “generic”and “predictable”, I think there’s only entertaining story’s for every genre, fantastic story’s that anyone can enjoy regardless of genre, and story’s where the writing doesn’t add up or makes since so it becomes almost impossible to enjoy(fairy tail).
Of course this is just my opinion but I’m happy people are starting to like more shonens like kny because they are actually good and not because they look on the surface and say it’s “generic”."

But unless the voting community is largely in retirement, they're practically forced to accept decriminalization at least (in some cases this is better depending on the coming regulations that are proposed with legalization), legalization possibly.

All you have to do is say the word ""SCIENCE!"" and people won't dare question what you say. Meanwhile, these people are doing the exact same thing that religious people do by just blindly following the words of anyone with perceived power.

I'm no scientist and I won't pretend to understand the ins and outs of how this all works but I do know that it's....complicated. You have to take into account scientific theory, hypotheses, peer reviews, how and why these studies get funded, who is behind the funding, etc. To simply shout ""SCIENCE!"" when you try and make a point isn't enough to convince me. Scientists are still people prone to corruption and greed or just flat out being wrong on something. Science is not infallible but it's treated by many people as if it were."

You're telling me that somehow, despite those demographics, the majority of residents are non-Canadians? They're all foreigners?

Billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein paid off the Duchess of York’s debts within days of Prince Andrew flying out to visit him in New York.

But the now infamous deal was eventually struck in December as her ex-husband holidayed with Epstein for the first time since 2006, sources confirmed."

10531,"Welcome to the anime community! This is my general recommendation list which covers quite a few genres and eras. Browse through and find a genre that interest you! Openings/endings are linked to give you a feel for the show.

Fantasy

- Attack on Titan (2013) A dark fantasy action series about fighting man eating giants. The anime has incredible animation and an awesome soundtrack. I also think it has one of the best first two episodes in anime. Lots of mystery and cliffhangers and as the heroes uncover more about their twisted world they slowly change forever.

[Attack on Titan OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvpZHdC80lE)

- FMAB (Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood) (2009) A boy makes a Faustian bargain and has to revert the consequences by going on an adventure to find a mystical stone of alchemy the philosopher stone. The show deals with imperialism, militarism, redemption, forgiveness, the value of human life and the danger of the extremes of pure faith and rationality. (recommend the dub as a sub watcher)

[FMAB OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PusR3agGeio)


- Yona of the Dawn (2014) Action/adventure with a Korean low fantasy setting. Lots of character development occurs regarding the main character throughout the series one of my favorite Female MC’s (her journey from spoiled princess to dashing rogue is wonderful). You might have to switch to the manga when you are done with the anime unfortunately. Manga is fairly successful, but it’s been awhile since the last season. Author is a fan of LOTR and its reflected in the story as it’s a big epic fantasy adventure.

[Yona of the Dawn OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqTVcpmpA)


- Spirited Away (2001) A girl named Chihiro and her family enter into a world dominated by various spirits. After her parents are turned into pigs Chihiro must find a way to turn them back to normal and escape.

[Spirited Away English Dub trailer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsrWpFmB2bQ)


Science Fiction:

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series with animation that holds up amazing well today. It also had one of the best endings in anime in my opinion. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well-regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that.  (recommend the dub as a sub watcher)

[Cowboy Bebop OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)

- Psycho Pass (2012) A cyberpunk detective story and one of the better villains I have seen in anime. Has some interesting views on society mainly dealing with the issue of an over monitored  state. I would say it’s like Minority Report if you have seen that movie. 

[Psycho Pass OP 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Q4emwDFYg&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLAbghykhSTZPNEqvWnC8ZuAEU_PazwJZm)


- Redline (2009) Adrenaline the anime. Film is just basically about this massive death race and has some of the best animation ever.

[Redline Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t26m_Q6ENo)

- Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) Teens are forced to fight for the survival of mankind against monsters known as Angels. Quite a few themes like a look at the writer's ongoing depression play a huge role in the series (make sure you watch the film End of Evangelion for the ending)

[Neon Genesis Evangelion OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-QSmNReDyI)


- Code Geass (2006) Is another really popular anime deals with the moral complexities of revolution and rebellion. It takes place in an alternate history and it’s also a pretty good intro to the mecha genre. Some great character development and moral dilemmas that the characters face.

[Code Geass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ7zQbMxm28)

- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) (Remake 2018-) A great epic space opera with a conflict focused on a corrupt democracy fighting a enlightened despot. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book of 10 original has covered all. My advice watch the two prequel films My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War (skip the first two episodes of the main series if you do) then the original OVA, Gaiden and then the remake.

 [Legend of the Galactic Heroes OP 3]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hryo6H57y6I)
 

- Ghost in the Shell (Film 1995) (SAC 2002) Film is more philosophical taking a look at human consciousness and what it means to be human. SAC is more of a straight up crime drama.

[Ghost in the Shell Film Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvBVDibOrgs)

[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG  OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0)


- The Promised Neverland (2019) Sci Fi/Supernatural Anime about children escaping an orphanage after discovering a horrifying secret. Battles of wits as direct confrontation is impossible. 

[The Promised Neverland Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApLudqucq-s)




Action/Adventure (Other):

- My Hero Academia (2016) Great show to check out if you like the Marvel or DC superhero films. A typical underdog rises to the top story but it’s really well executed and has a cast of beloved characters with some good action and a great soundtrack

[My Hero Academia OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu0HjPzFYnY)

- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) Generational action shonen that involves multiple characters throughout time. Adapted from an older manga that is still going after decades. Has a very unique sense of style with a really creative battle system that makes it standout from many action shonen. Would give it until episode 12 to know if its for you. (Part 1 is considered the weakest of the 8)

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3 OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmaTmLTWoU)

- Mob Psycho (2016) Action comedy about a psychic boy and his mentor a con artist fighting other psychics and the various spirits that plague their city while he learns to grow as a person.

[Mob Psycho 100 OP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lpApXzwAP0&amp;index=2&amp;list=FLsNBO_i0YOwmyoaxjB-AZ7g&amp;t=0s)

- Black Lagoon (2006) Anime about mercenaries and modern day piracy on the high seas. (recommend the dub as a sub watcher)

10552,"Congratulations. You've demonstrated an utter lack of comprehension of why intelligence agencies exist. They provide the context, and an analysis of whether or not your little irrelevant protest group could pose a threat, to infrastructure, economic security, national security etc... Based on that, when you go out and protest, you don't get your heads beaten in by police truncheons.

The alternative is to assume your protest is a threat until it proves it is not, which of course you cannot, because to do otherwise would be irresponsible to those not involved in your protest. 

But instead, CSIS looks at the pipeline protestors, gathers their info and says that most of them will just make a lot of noise, maybe block a road, and that's it. No real damage, no real threat. 

Because an intelligence analyst has decided you're harmless, you're allowed to exercise your right to protest, despite you abrogating someone else's right to free movement.

10629,"&gt; Look, you're using biased language 

Don't lie. You called me biased before my last comment. Perhaps you should take a step back and judge how emotional you're acting (about an issue that you supposedly don't care about). And what Tito did to those people was brainwashing. It wasn't an identity they chose, it was an identity that was imposed on them

&gt; Similarly if you tell people that a disputed Status   
&gt;  
&gt; those claims of origins from Tito  

""Disputed"" status? What do you even mean by that? And claims of origins? I was pretty specific about Tito

From what we know of the history of the world they had the ability to be titans without the toxins, we don't know quite how this all worked as it hasn't gone into depth.

&gt;And like i said is one of the plot points the realization of the Maleryan fighters that the Eldrians, their country framed as monsters, re in fact normal people. But you didnt give an answer to how that collides with your points

But they are still literally man eating monsters. It doesn't matter if they are portrayed as the good guys.

10679,It’s too fucking early in the season to be sweating like this
10680,"This is the reality I'm dealing with right now as well. Despite having a good career in IT, I don't make nearly enough to be able to comfortably live on my own (comfortably meaning that I can save a sizeable amount each month - I'm not looking to live in luxury or anything). For the forseeable future, I have to live with my parents to be able to have progress in savings. I'm 31 and honestly can't see an end in sight. I don't know when I'll be able to move out. I'm single so I don't have the benefit of a partner's income to supplement my own (and being 31 and still living with my parents is kind of a buzzkill from a dating perspective lmao, doubly so because I'm a male).

It's not so easy to just pick up and move either. My field job market is strongest in Toronto and the GTA. Additionally, I feel a responsibility to help take care of my parents as they age. I would feel massive guilt if I moved far away and couldn't be around to help take care of them. I help them a bit financially but also I worry for their health. So I'm kind of anchored in the GTA, and I'm feeling paralyzed as to what to do about my own future.

Commuting sucks, but if you can make progress with saving by moving back with the parents, I would suggest it. Not ideal of course, but we're living in less than ideal circumstances :(. Good luck to you, friend."

There was a marketing angle, a very successful one at that, that the record companies could take advantage of. They also hit at a time that could capitalize off of Gen X's anger and angst.

10686,"There was an idealistic time when MMOs were designed, in an elementary way, to be virtual worlds. You were SUPPOSED to sink your life into them. That was the entire point. Instead of iterating on that and becoming even more involved and life encompassing, they went the other way, and did their best to have you spend as little time as possible in them with as little to do as possible. 

Wow has become so streamlined, I'm honestly not sure how much more they can slim it down. At least there are MMOs like FF14 that still have a wide variety of things to do (and much, much, much, much better story)."

But when I'm given an old system to upgrade/fix, say a plane, that's in imperial units, it's much easier to keep using those imperial units, and just make the next one metric in a few years. Just take a look at a catalog like McMaster-Carr. There's a good reason it's got both metric and imperial bolts. If your entire country is filled with machines in the old system, you can't just strip them all out (imagine trying to replace every elevator, alone). It's a gradual process as companies switch themselves to the better system, forcing it won't change the reality of existing hardware."

You are oversimplifying a complex issue by saying more trades workers will solve it, sure it is part of the solution, but the problem is so much larger than that. Middle class wages have been stagnant since the 80s, this isn't an issue in one industry. Our tech industry pays well below what is offered south of the border, entry level positions are pretty much requiring University degrees across the board, our manufacturing industry has been slowly dying, and companies are filling lower paying / skilled jobs with TFW's.

This is the result of well over a decade of failure from multiple governments. Scheer isn't going to solve it any more than Doug Ford has."

No, that's the thing.  You can't.   Not if you have court ordered child support.   There's more than one story of someone losing their job and getting a lower paying one and the court not readjusting.  So then they can't afford to pay, so they go to jail, then they lose their job because of the jail,  while support payments still rack up while they're in jail, so they're further in debt, and it's just a vicious cycle.

He hands me the bong, I pull a couple cones and after a few minutes a smile forms across my face. We chat, play Xbox for a while then pull a few more cones. At this point I'm feeling very interesting, got that tingling sensation in my legs, arms and head as though millions of warm little fireworks are going off all over my body. My friend suggests we go for a walk to change up the scenery a bit, I agree and this is where things become mind bending and eye opening.

We proceed out to the front of the house and begin walking down the street at night, it's a warm night and the moon is full, very comfortable. As I'm walking I start to lose feeling in my legs, looking down I cannot feel my legs although I am still walking completely normal. I think to myself, this is awesome and I let go of anything that was holding me back. I have now lost feeling of everything below the neck, it feels incredible. It's as though autopilot has been switched on in my brain, I just think about where I wanna go and my arms and legs take care of the rest like my body is a rollercoaster and my mind is along for the ride.

That lasts for about 10 minutes until it escalates into an out of body experience where I am watching myself walk in third person from behind and from there I can't explain.

*Prankster's primary* would be an automatic projectile gun with slight homing capabilities. With a firerate 1/4 of a second and a clip of 20. The projectiles would move the same speed as Symmetra's orbs. Right click would create a large ( I mean hero sized ) slow moving one at expense of the whole clip. Creating this orb would push the Prankster back. Size of the orb would depend on the the remaining amount of ammo in the current clip.

*Shift* could send a copy of the trickster forward, shooting any heroes during it's travel. Copy would deal reduced damage at enemies. This ability would heal the trickster when used and the trickster can recast this ability to swap positions with the copy. 

*Prankster's E* would create a copy of a targeted allied hero that would last for something like 5 seconds and would start to mimic the target's movements after 1 second. The copy would shoot at enemies dealing reduced damage. ( Basically it would stay still for 1 second and start moving to same direction as the target after the 1 second delay is over. ). This ability would also heal and cleanse the allied target of CC.

Copies would use the PvE mission AI aim where they don't track perfectly and instead have a set rotation speed. This would make them more realistic to fool people and wouldn't make them another turret type of ability. The maximum damage they can deal isn't a percentage of their original damage and instead their DPS would be capped to a certain extent. 

*Prankster's ultimate* creates a dome around the Prankster that obstructs the vision of enemy heroes and the dome would heal allies within it for 60 hp per second.

Then just add a personality built around that kit. With sneering voicelines when enemies are shooting at the copies and playful laughter when you save allies from CC."

10798,"Speaking on behalf of my husband for this question since he isn't on Reddit.

He spent *weeks* trying to get past a particular fight scene in Resident Evil (sorry, don't remember which one) and just could not win. Over and over I listened to that NPC call out her partner's name as he died because my husband just isn't the sort of guy that gives up easily. Then came a day when he finally(!!) beat the difficult scene. Hooray!! All was great!! Those weeks of struggle were over!! But just as he killed the boss, I leaned over the dresser, directly in front of the Xbox, and as I reached to pick something up my big six-months-along pregnant belly tapped the button and shut the entire console off. All progress lost with no chance of recovery.

Without making a peep, my husband turned several interesting shades of red, gave me a single chaste kiss on the forehead, and walked out of the house. He did eventually return a few hours later and swore he didn't hold it against me but it's been seven years and I still feel horribly guilty over it."

If we were to see an increase in the level for comp access (I wouldn't be against it, but not that high) we need better game modes to level up in. QP is a terrible experience and doesn't help in the slightest for new players, arcade is also very little help outside of helping hone your mechanics. There needs to be some way to play OW the way it was meant to be played, without being in full competitive yet."

10833,"&gt;But it is a fact that the majority of people from alot of eastern bloc countries miss how things used to be.

And I reiterate the fact again that old people's perceptions are subjective and more often than not warped by nostalgia. When you're analyzing a historical period, you have to rely on more than just the testimonies of individuals who lived during that time. That is why people go to archives and rely on those documents when they want to do serious research on the past. 

&gt;The end of the USSR was the biggest drop in life expectancy and lving standards since WW2.

Sure but that was the case in non socialist countries too. Japan for example was never socialist and it also experienced rapid growth during the 60s and 70s and quickly became an economic powerhouse.

&gt;Also, if you've studied yugoslavis you know that Titos specific brand of market socialism and foreign policy left him somewhat adrift internationally.

Yes which is why it wasn't a complete shithole like Romania or Hungary at the time. It managed to protect its sovereignty by rejecting Stalin's authority and yes from the 60s it started to allow some small private businesses to exist. However, like with virtually all socialist systems Yugoslavia was spending a shitton of money that it didn't actually have, hence why the debt was soaring and why the entire structure was unsustainable."

This was the chance for the nobility to take back their power by placing a disinterested, disabled, spacey-eyed boy on the throne.  Lip service to centralized government and a chance to rule their own way in their own territory.  I think that may be why there was not a peep said when the North declared independence.  It was very much in their personal interests and was handed to them on a silver platter.  No danger of Bran the Broken roasting them alive in their keeps."

10850,"&gt; No, because he obviously couldn't be physically there yet since he only just got freed, 

How is that ""obvious""?

The dude is massive. Old Gods are literally described as mountains of flesh in the Chronicles. What makes you think he *couldn't* ascend?

&gt; and we're even shown how far down he actually is with them showing him open the one eye he has in the current area.

*The one eye they let us see.* 

&gt; The fact he also uses a shadow tentacle to grab Azshara instead of his physical tentacle suggests he can't move his physical body entirely yet, 

Which is, depending on where the story ends up landing, potentially irrelevant. As Taliesin pointed out, they could have let it be a very real, very physical tentacle instead of some shadows.

So unless they plan on making that relevant, maybe having to descend to Nya'lotha to meet N'Zoth, I'd say they could have just let N'Zoth encapsulate the entire area.

&gt; N'zoth's deliberately playing low-key. 

You mean by announcing ""All eyes will be opened"" and by not trying to attack or kill any of the Horde or Alliance members, meaning they can let the rest of their factions know?

&gt; So low-key that in the after raid dialogue both Lorthemar and Jaina don't actually seem to realize how much of a bad situation they're actually in. 

Uh, what?

&gt; Lor'themar: Our victory rings hollow. Azshara's master will rise. Nothing can stop that now.

&gt; Jaina: For all her lies, Priscilla Ashvane spoke one truth. The war between the Alliance and Horde has kept us distracted. **Divided, we have no hope against N'Zoth.**

&gt; Lor'themar: We may have found common cause here in Nazjatar, but the battle still rages beyond these waters. So long as Sylvanas holds Orgrimmar, there can be no lasting peace. 

&gt; Jaina: The war needs to end, Lor'themar. You know this to be true.

&gt; Lor'themar: I had hoped that reason would prevail. But the time has come to finish this. 

&gt; Lor'themar: I will tell my people what transpired here. Of how Azshara fell because we stood together. **Of the threat rising from the depths, and all that is at stake if we should fail.**

&gt; Lor'themar: Then I will take my place beside Saurfang and Thrall, and pray that the sin'dorei stand with me.

They seem pretty aware to me.

Where on earth do you get the idea that they're not cognisant of what just transpired?

&gt; It's either N'zoth cannot raise his entire body + the Black Empire, or he doesn't want to. The former means there's a timer on how much time the NPCs have to prepare for it, the latter means he's preparing something even bigger.

Why is this the case to you?

For all we know, that timer is ticking away *imminently* and 8.3 will be N'Zoth's onslaught. The thing is, they could easily write that N'Zoth is not ""full power,"" but still capable enough to be a world-ending threat that *demands* the Horde and Alliance band together. N'Zoth's power level is dynamic to the needs of the story they want to tell.

So if they want the timer to tick away until 9.0 when he is ready, and the Horde and Alliance have supposedly-conclusively resolved their differences in time through the 8.3 patch, they can. Alternatively, if they want N'Zoth to crash the faction-war party and demand their *immediate* attention, they can.

There is nothing ""low-key"" about this, though. Lor'Themar and Jaina are both aware of the shit they've just been thrown into, both are planning to make ends meet so they can focus on bailing themselves out of it.

So unless they *had* to write N'Zoth as physically incapable of writhing through the Palace to retrieve Azshara with physical tentacles, I'd say they could have done that instead."

They can still probably put out numbers against lower teams, but their place on the HLTV ranking reflects the reality that they are no longer really in contention for a top 3 team anymore. It's almost strange to think about how they could have been affected so hard by their recent attendance/performance, but there's nothing else to point at. They're the same 5 players that turned CS:GO into near-enough being a *science*, but they're a shadow of that team. Their mental is completely shot, which was one of their biggest points when they were on top, that no matter the situation they would hold it together and come out with good rounds. They don't even appear to have done enough prep for their opponents at this point. If it wasn't for the fact that their players keep having the occasional insane round, I wouldn't even believe this is the same people. 

Like I said, what do you point to? The only thing that we can see as fans is that they took a ridiculously long break from constant high-tier CS, and the only conclusion we can really draw is that without the pressure they lost their touch. This is *old* Astralis, through and through."

If you can get him to work support though, please let me know. I like his kit and character and having a weird flex pick like that would be pretty nice.

I wonder if GRRM will go for a meta angle. As in, ""ultimately, this all was the chronicle of Bran"" or something. He knows everything now, so that means he also embodies the story of ASOIAF/GoT. IIRC he was also the first POV character in the books.

10965,"I still question the moon landings, at least the footage, but to put a few things in perspective:

-  Most of the world was still recovering from WW II, except for the victors (US/Russia) who were deadlocked in their own arms race

-  The technologies capable of carrying man into space, rocketry, are highly regulated industries.  Just look at places like NK/Iran.  Look at governing bodies like the AEC, and global nuclear power regulators.  Countries, still reeling from WW2, weren't trying to get these for spaceflight, they were trying to get these materials for defense


Now, more than ever, technologies are accessible to other nations.  Look at countries like China, Japan, India, the EU; they all are starting to explore deeper into space.  Japan with their impressive asteroid drones last year.  India &amp; China both within reach of the moon, China already.  The EU doing more and more on Mars exploration, coordinating with NASA.

From the start of the series, you can see the guilds from Fairy Tail, the Captain/Lieutenant dynamic and demon sword power within from Bleach, and the rival attitude as well as the “I want to be Hokage/Pirate King/Magic King” from One Piece and Naruto. 

At the tournament arc, a lot of the new characters resemble characters from other series, as well as having a tournament arc to begin with. One of the most notable examples is Mimosa’s brother who is literally just a vain version of Byakuya from Bleach. Pink flower petals, powerful, noble, nobility is a defining character aspect, won’t recognize outsiders as equals. 

I love Black Clover and I don’t fault it for doing this because of one reason.

Sure, it doesn't include everything, but it dropped what it could to still feel like a full movie that wasn't missing anything, and it did a good job of it. I'm kind of glad that it didn't have everything, because when I decided to read it a year after seeing the movie, I got to enjoy some new content as well.

The one thing I think that the movie didn't do right was skipping the backstory for mother Nishima. After the movie, I hated her almost as much as the female bully and the girl that acted like she never was a part of the bullying. The backstory on what Nishima went through did a 180 turn on my opinion of her and now I understand why she gets included in Best Girl contests."

11030,What a stupid play call
11031,"&gt;Bro, you're confusing decimalisation with metrication. US customary units have regular used decimalisation when appropriate for hundreds of years.

Replace metrification with decimalisation and everything that I said is true. The decimalisation of customary units is the metric system bleeding into US units.

Decimalisation and Metrification might not be the same, but they go hand in hand because decimalisation of units that are not based on a base 10 system is inherently limited.

&gt;People love to talk about metric like decimalisation was it's biggest contribution, but that has been around for a long time, and use of decimalisation in measurement systems predates metric (though it does require a base-10 number system...a base-12 number system would almost certainly be better, but isn't worth the effort of changing).

The idea is older, but the first actual implementation (in the West) happened with the introduction of the metric units.

&gt;The big contribution of metric was clearly defining related units in reasonable ways relative to other units (like, for example, how one L is a 10 cm³ cube).

I know this, I'm a physicist. I just never heard of ""decimalisation"" as it's own word and think people will understand what I wrote above."

11069,"Flying was intended to be specific to Burning Crusade when it was first implemented, but people enjoyed the mechanic so much and Blizzard realized they still had a lot of development space to integrate flying in better ways than what they'd done during TBC.

They showed part of this off with WotLK, and part of what spurred Cataclysm's world-rework was to make flying possible on the main continents.  After that, though, Blizzard started to realize that they'd painted themselves into a corner.  

Flying massively improves quality of life, but it takes a lot of interaction out of the game.  On the PvE side, players were no longer on the ground to see others and join them, meaning the game became less about social interaction and more about doing only what that specific player *needed* to do.  On the world PvP side, people that don't want to fight can just fly away with relative impunity, meaning PvPers eventually stop trying and counter-PvPers lose their target.

It's not only the most efficient form of travel (move in straight line versus going around obstacles), it's the safest form of travel (cannot be ganked, NPCs cannot dismount) and the fastest form of travel (more than twice as fast as ground mounts at 200% versus 410%).

What can they do to fix it?  Basically, nothing.  Adding NPCs that specifically dismount flying would be awful to play with, because flying dismounts have the additional punishment of falling damage.  Slowing down flying mounts so ground mounts can be faster than them would receive the ultimate shitstorm from the community.  So, they do what they can, which is lock it behind an achievement so they can at least delay the inevitable trivialization of the expansion.

This has unfortunately reflected in their design of maps, too.  In TBC to Cataclysm, flying was an intended mode of travel and they made secrets and content accessible through flying.  Now, flying is an excuse to not care about map layout, because the playerbase will eventually ignore it all anyways.  Let the artists go wild and slap some invisible walls to prevent clipping or getting stuck too often.  People always proclaim the artists are doing a good job anyways."

11141,"My crackpot theory is that the highlights pushed out the other content. Some time ago, some dude posted a highlight, and it was okay and cool, because there weren't many highlights posted. Then, another. ""Hey, these are pretty neat"".....

And so on, until highlights started becoming less notable. Eventually, they devolved into ""press Q"" highlights, because there was no effort made to prevent highlights like these from being posted. No filtering.

Other games have rules about ""mass content"" that can be produced cheaply, they'll say stuff like ""the highlight must involve X, in X or Y gamemodes only, and only from rank Z or higher gameplay"". This cuts the amount down considerably, allowing other things like memes and fanart and discussion to exist. That's how those subs sustain that ""anything goes"" feel. 

If we want /r/OW to become like that, highlights need to be dramatically suppressed. I think a ruleset like:

- Highlight must be from ladder or pro play, any rank is fine
- Highlight must display player skill, either aim or gamesense. No ""single button POTGs"".
- Highlight must be edited to remove the OW logo on both ends of the clip.

There, boom. 80% of highlights blocked, freeing up space for discussion, memes, and OC. Ez. It'd require a good bit more mod work, and banning people who keep trying to post poor highlights might be necessary, but it'd fix the problem."

11144,"Butterfly fever is non-canon to the show's story. I believe the only reference the show makes to the butterflies of Naath is Davos recalling being told how beautiful the palm trees and butterflies were in Season 7.

Missandei says she would like to see Naath again. Grey Worm pledges to protect the people of Naath who can't protect themselves.

For those quick to jump on the writers as being [lying creators](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator) and that butterfly fever is canon, consider [unreliable narration](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator)."

Just because it is ""universally accepted"" does not mean this is fact at all. Look at things in the past like bloodletting. This was accepted as a legitimate medical treatment, but it really wasn't.

Public documentation, public acceptance, all of these things don't signify anything. The amount of ""public documentation proving the holocaust"" that is comparable to humor is laughable.

If you look into his comment history you will see [he's very heavily biased](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/cvr9x3/some_shameful_things_about_current_brazil/). [Here too](https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/csb354/eu_pessoalmente_sou_mto_contra_bolsonaro_mas_me/). 

Here's an impartial answer:

He was convicted by Moro, actual Justice Minister for Bolsonaro, on one of the fastest corruption conviction ever. Most likely to avoid him running to Presidency and evading all the charges. 

There has been a mild scandal, because The Intercept received freely the dump from the prosecutor messages, which included messages with the judge, other prosecutors, his wife and several other people, from a hacker. Keep in mind that they are political biased in Brazil, the journalist have been with Lula several times and is married to a politician from the opposition party. The messages are most likely true, but the news decline to provide the raw evidence, takes several messages out of context and has been found editing some of them.

But here's the most important part: Lula has been convicted by 3 different judicial bodies on 2 crimes (Moro convicted him on 3), there are literally hundred more criminal charges ongoing, several whistleblowers from his own party and the biggest companies in the Brazil saying that he was the leader of the whole corruption scandal and thousands of paper evidence.

So, yes, Moro, most likely was unethical on the conviction, but that so far hasn't affected any of the charges on Lula, even after his lawyer team pleading to it. But he was also convicted of other crimes and other judges, on higher levels, have convicted Lula too."

11195,"&gt;Wanting to identify a person is not a valid reason for detention

The problem with this ruling is that is a very valid reason for detention. The HTA in every province allows police to stop a driver without any other grounds to believe an offence has actually occurred and check the following:

- does the driver have a valid DL
- does the vehicle have proof of insurance
- does the vehicle have a valid registration 
- sobriety of the driver
- mechanical fitness of the vehicle

So if this officer had testified he was simply stopping the vehicle (and detaining the driver) to verify one of these 5 things, the stop is entirely justified and constitutional. The judge has now ruled that while the stop was made to identify the driver, which is a lawful stop, the stop itself is unconstitutional because the officer informed the driver that he was stopped for another reason."

11258,"&gt; While this is true, a good jungler makes opportunity.

This is a partial truth. It is still very possible for the laner to put the lane in a very bad position for ganks, and not every jungle/lane duo/trio can manage a dive against every opposing lane.

Also, many times I notice laners not understanding that the jungler plays the whole map and not just their lane. You can't hardfeed the enemy multiple times and constantly complain that your jungler isn't there. You knew they weren't there, so set up your lane for ganks and ping for it. At least then you can go on knowing you did all you could, and if your jungler didn't get another lane ahead/didn't get off good objective control and invades, then clearly they just didn't want to win. I say this as a support player. I just hate when I see someone constantly getting ganked by the enemy jungler, feeding, and then blaming our jungler for not ganking.

It's a more complex issue than ""jungler should gank, if they're good then they can make the gank work no matter what."""

11272,My mother always measured the semi solid things like butter and vegetable shortening by floating the volume in liquid. So you need half cup of butter. Grab a liquid measuring cup of size 2 cups and fill the liquid to 1 cup line. Then float the butter until the water reached the 1.5 cup line ensuring the butter to be measured was completely submerged. You now have half cup of butter.

&gt; Stone Temple Pilots (often abbreviated as STP) is a Grammy Award winning American rock band from San Diego, California, that originally consisted of Scott Weiland (lead vocals), brothers Dean (guitar) and Robert DeLeo (bass, backing vocals), and Eric Kretz (drums). Since the band's formation in 1989, its line-up remained unchanged until the dismissal of Weiland in 2013, who was replaced by Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington. In 2015, Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park. On December 3, 2015, Weiland was found dead on his tour bus prior to a performance with his band The Wildabouts. Bennington committed suicide on July 20, 2017. In November 2017, the band hired former X-Factor contestant Jeff Gutt as their new lead singer.

&gt; After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. The band found immediate success in 1993 upon releasing their debut album, Core (1992), and went on to become one of the most commercially successful bands of the 1990s.[7] The band released four more studio albums: Purple (1994), Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop (1996), No. 4 (1999) and Shangri-La Dee Da (2001), before separating in 2002, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone). The band eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released a new self-titled album in 2010, and have been actively touring since, even after Weiland was fired from the band. The band's only material with Bennington was the EP High Rise in 2013.[8]

&gt; While initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.

&gt; The band's five studio albums have sold over 17 million copies in the United States alone. The band has had fifteen top ten singles on the Billboard rock charts, including six number ones, and one number one album on the pop charts (1994's Purple). In 1993, the band won a Grammy for ""Best Hard Rock Performance"" for their song ""Plush"". Stone Temple Pilots were also ranked at number 40 on VH1's The 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2003, the band released the greatest hits compilation Thank You. Around this time, band members began going their separate ways. After the band's break-up in  2003 , original lead singer Scott Weiland became the frontman of Velvet Revolver with former members of Guns N' Roses. The DeLeo brothers formed the band Army of Anyone with Richard Patrick of the band Filter. Kretz founded Bomb Shelter Studios in Los Angeles.

&gt; The band reunited in 2008 after Weiland split from Velvet Revolver, kicking off the tour at the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio. The band released their self titled sixth album in 2010.

11288,"I'm typing the incidents as I read them so as to, hopefully, catch the pattern;

&gt; By then, Sirois had already apologized for gaps in procedure — there had been two earlier incidents between the boy and T.Q.’s daughter, one in November and one in December.

&gt; In one, the boy was accused of saying he didn’t like the girl’s “N—— hair.” He denied using the N-word, and the guidance counsellor believed she had brokered a peace between the two kids (and indeed, there were no further clashes until March 27).

There are precisely 3 incidents.  

&gt; When I characterized the boy's behaviour as relentless bullying, I wasn't referring only to the behaviour in the classroom that day, I was referring to his pattern of bullying this particular girl. 

Only withing the context of victimhood culture could this be understood as ""relentless bullying"". 

We needn't go into the girls bullying of students she doesn't like - to the point of earning her suspensions from her previous school, as in the framework of dignity culture - it doesn't excuse the boys behavior in any way."

11334,"How was it well foreshadowed? Her going crazy wasn't a surprise in the show because Tyrion and Varys were both about as subtle as Tormund was about wanting to bang brienne. The writers laid it on thick in season 8, but that's cuz they had to the justify the ending they went with. I am still waiting to see all this foreshadowing. 

What I don't consider foreshadowing to Dany's turn to madness: 

-Showing no emotion when Viserys was killed. He had sold her into sex slavery, told her he would allow all the dothraki and their horses to rape her in order to get the throne, and threatened to kill the baby in the womb. 

-Burning the witch. That witch basically killed her husband and her child, which was pretty much leaving Dany to die.

Threatening to burn cities to the ground. This is about as close as you get, but its still a stretch. She was desperate and angry and trying to survive. People tend to say all sorts of bold things when they are pushed. But when she actually got the power she did not burn down Qarth, Astapor, Meereen or Yunkai. She freed the slaves.

-Crucifying the masters. That was in retaliation to the masters Crucifying children.

-Executing the Tarleys. They were enemy combatants and oath breakers. And were given multiple chances to live, but they refused. 

-People saying that it's just a coin toss whether Targaryens go mad. This is just a few people saying what they believe, not based on anything other than Dany's father going crazy. 

Most of the examples of foreshadowing i have seen are not foreshadowing of her turn to madness, but rather foreshadowing of her tendency to use violence to achieve her goals. The examples listed above do not in the least bit show Daenerys as a person prone to going crazy. They show her as a person that will use force to achieve her goals. But that is not a trait unique to Daenerys. Robert Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon, Robb Stark, Jon Snow, Tywin Lannister, etc all have that trait. Pretty much every ruler in Westeros has that tendency. So it's pretty meaningless example of foreshadowing. 

What am I missing? I do not believe Dany's turn to madness was actually foreshadowed. I believe it was hastily thrown together, and actions from past episodes are being retconned to justify this poorly executed plot point."

If it is a business *they* want access to and are denied, their rights are being infringed.

The speed with which they will transition from the second to the third without even skipping a beat is absolutely breathtaking. I know it's not fair to generalize an entire group of people based on a handful of interactions, but the pattern I've seen with respect to this issue has been pretty consistent so far.

Having said all of that, I do think you've got a leg to stand on. YouTube exists in this really weird space- in a way it's kinda like the modern 'public square'. It's got a reach that's (as far as I know) not equaled by anything else out there, but we don't regulate it or treat it like we would any other public space.

11396,"Radiohead and Saint Seiya references? This is very weird reference combo right there.

Interesting development for Sato here. I'm mostly interested in how his relationship with Yuki and the other guys' was. If I had my guess, I bet they were all in a band and Sato was the singer and Yuki was the bassist. Then, Yuki died and the band separated. My biggest question is what happened with Sato. Did he transfer from his old school for reasons unknown or what? It's really interesting to slowly figure out what's up with the guy.

I wanna give special props to the supporting characters, who have actually been really cool this season. Like, Uenoyama's (or his actual name ""UENOYAMA-KUN"") basketball friends. His friends, who could've been so easily obnoxious and just boring, nothing characters, but the writing and the voice actors (who are all amazing) really sell their goofiness and the fact that they actually like Sato is cool too (Plus, they are great mood-savers in the beginning of this episode). Hell, even Ueno's sister can be really funny too and I'm interested to see if she bring anymore to the show.

I also give major props to the show for taking it's time. Usually, shows that are like this would probably skip what Sato is doing in this episode (I mean, can you blame them? It's just Sato walking around the city), but just the way it's directed shows that he's looking for inspiration. He's looking for a way to describe his feelings to Yuki and it's hard for him to do it. It's fascinating and the fact that the show is so willing to just let it happen is really cool. Though Sato goes -2 points for not walking his pooch while he goes walking around. That poor doggy loves Sato. Why can't Sato bring him along!

Honestly, there's so much stuff too talk about this episode where really nothing happens. I mean yeah, they finished the song, but besides that? Nothing much. Yet, the tone (which makes me feel so warm just for the colors and the aesthetic alone) and the characters help elevate these episodes even more."

I have no idea if any of this is true, and I haven't seen it reported anywhere else. But it seems like they're going to considerable lengths to disprove this even though his suspension has already been served."

There has been a real opportunity with the personal weakness of Trudeau, and the NDP has had an opportunity to exploit that to their advantage. Instead, they’ll help get this fool  Re elected.

And yes, the memories of those smoke sessions are fuzzy lol people that young shouldn’t smoke weed in my opinion. Every time it was a very intense experience as a youngster. I didn’t have the appropriate influence at the time to encourage me to wait until I was older, and I credit that to me never telling anyone I used a series of drugs, but ultimately I don’t regret my decisions I made. I tried a variety of “drugs” as a young teenager, but was at least wise enough to research what drugs were addictive and how to appropriately use different substances.

My mind today is a humble place due to a series of drug-related revelations and accidents, but I do truly wish I had more memory of my teen years. I had an extremely great set of friends and family, and sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I always chose them over whatever I was influenced by at the time.

You can keep raging, but the facts are there. G2 are a top 10 team and KennyS can still perform against the best as he has shown. It's not like it was some random online match either.

Up until around 5 years old I would bring cupcakes to the local firefighters and police officers that day though. that's as much celebrating as I've ever done. For the last few years I've been able to be more chill with it, when someone tells me happy birthday or anything I'll respond saying ""it's a National Tragedy!!!"" In the most excited tone I can manage. And as the date approaches I make and print out some business cards with the answers to most questions I get on them. 

It's usually ""yes, I was born on 9/11/01. My mother went into labor when the first tower was hit. I was born in Florida. Yes it does suck, I hate it. No, I don't celebrate. You can keep this card.""

My ideal celebration is definitely a casual happy birthday from close friends and family and then treating it like it's not my birthday."

11572,"Wow, what a dissapointing movie. I was invested throughout most of it, but I was always anticipating a twist of some kind. But nope, the movie plays out exactly like the mission briefing laid out.

In fact, while the plot was engaging in itself, the movie had no real story to tell. It felt more like a documentary about what space-travel might look like in 50 years.

And then there's some of the inconsistencies in tone (monkey scene), physics (anti-matter storms?) and plot.

Again, another impressive movie that fails because it doesn't manage a proper script."

GG Hawks, you definitely deserve the W more than the Oilers tonight."
11579,But it’s not alliterative with his name! Lol
11580,"  

Be cautious here: 

The number of confirmed cases may be zero (I’m not sure if this is true) but that is not the same as the number of actual cases. It is very difficult to correlate cause and effect especially when many people that vape also have smoked or do smoke tobacco. Also, remember that vaping has only been widespread for a few years at this point. 

All this adds up to the conclusion that it’s far too early to say what the impact of vaping might be. There is recent evidence that vaping can cause damage to the lungs and increase the risk of pneumonia. But again, it’s hard to correlate the cause and effect with a degree of confidence at this point.

I agree with your sentiment that vaping is the better bet compared with tobacco at this point. The former may be dangerous and probably is to a point (lungs are pretty delicate things, and generally putting any kind of nasty shit in them is bad – the question is how bad). The latter is 100% dangerous and kills untold numbers of people every year without question. So yes, do vape rather than smoke. But honestly, the smart move is to do neither."
11581,"I recommend anyone interested sub to /r/Nunangat because a lot of posts are in syllabics/Inuk(ti)tut, and I am putting effort in changing a word or two here and there in the titles like ""[A direct election for ᓄᓇᕗᑦ premier?

11585,"To be clear, this is the exact same as the ""old math"" where you set one number on top of each other and multiply digits. It just explicitly describes what is happening.

The part that really throws people off is that there is no requirement to use 12 = 10 + 2. You can break up 12 however you want. Any of 8 + 4, 2 * 6, 9 + 2 + 1, 3 * 2 - 8 + 14 will work. The only things that matter are that the totals don't change and the breakdown should make the problem simpler to solve."

11614,"This is a pretty common misconception. 

Blizzard and the algorithm do not manipulate your SR, other than placements. 

Your SR is purely based upon win/loss statistics and Blizzard/the system genuinely does not care about you and your rank. 

But, a 50/50 win rate over a long sample size means that OP is is not contributing enough to be a carry and not underperforming enough to throw. Since he is merely a body in his games, it's a coin toss on if his team is better than theirs. 

It's not the system forcing him into 50/50 games because it feels that's where he belongs, it's just the way it naturally works out."

Just because his 'initial purpose' as a champion was to be a support, it doesn't mean that can't evolve if players believe his playstyle is better suited for another way. Kench is not failed design - he was simply too strong into bruisers, which just happen to be what 95% of top laners want to pick, and 95% of those players expect to just constantly fight and autowin lanes."

Then one by one, all of the popular channels would migrate over and would become a lot more popular because the content creators won't be hamstrung by all the political correctness imposed upon them by YouTube, and slowly, over time, YouTube would wither away and become a husk of its former self and it would get Myspace'd."

No, a process to see if that person has a reason to move here. For example family ties, or unfair persecution or danger at home.

What you are advocating for would create a race to the bottom and have negative consequences for the country. If you let anyone in to work, then that creates an oversupply of labor, with wages being pushed down and people suffering because of it.

If would also mean that richer countries drain the skilled labor supply of the poorer countries over time, meaning they will not have a good way of lifting themselves out of that poverty. If first world countries would take in everyone who shows up for a better live, and then after a few years return everyone who has failed, who is left in the poorer countries after some time?

And your way would not filter in advance, so people who want to come for crime and such would also get in. And it does not address the difference in way of live, culture, etc I addressed. What happens when you let in a ton of people who have grown up with hatred towards gay people in a country where being gay is acceptable? Those people will not suddenly change their mindset in a few days, that stuff takes generations and even the most progressive countries are still not there yet.

It's a noble idea to want to give everyone access to a better live, but it is not practical or sustainable in the long term. Better would be to open up more chances for education which can then be applied back home by the people, open up trade more (especially for small business) and find ways to invest in those poorer countries without the benefits going to a corrupt elite (rich countries need to hold their multinationals accountable and fine them in the billions for abusing the situation in poorer countries or use bribes or corruption)."

11827,"&gt; It's been one for ages - and teenage boys calling each other that doesn't change much about that.

Not really. 

It was first coined in the early 1900's for effeminate men, but it most certainly wasn't popularly used to attack gay men.

It most certainly wasn't used as one for ages,  at least compared to other hate slangs.

And teenage boys calling each other that literally does change how the term should be assessed. How the term is generally used literally reflects what the slang means over time, that's the point. 

Funny enough, despite you claim that it doesn't matter, wiki has a literal section about youth's usage of the therm:

&gt; Through ethnographic research in a high school setting, CJ Pascoe examined how American high school boys used the term fag during the early 2000s. Pascoe's work suggested that these boys used the fag epithet as a way to assert their own masculinity, by claiming that another boy is less masculine; this, in their eyes, makes him a fag, and its **usage suggests that it is less about sexual orientation and more about gender.** One-third of the boys in Pascoe's study claimed that they would not call a homosexual peer a fag, leading Pascoe to argue that fag is used in this setting as a form of gender policing, in which boys ridicule others who fail at masculinity, heterosexual prowess, or strength. Because boys do not want to be labeled a fag, they hurl the insult at another person. Pascoe felt the fag identity does not constitute a static identity attached to the boy receiving the insult. Rather, fag is a fluid identity that boys strive to avoid, often by naming another as the fag. As Pascoe asserts, ""[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it""

South Point has a great episode about it too, which ridicules some of these notions.

11915,This is the equivalent to the Broken Shore back in Legion.  It was just a set of dailies and a few quests to lead you to the 7.2 raid Tomb of Sargeras.

Not a single one has a flesh arm or leg. As such, I can only assume that they are born as gnome manatees, and given cybernetics shortly after infancy. 

My curiosity is why they don’t build longer/stronger limbs, to make them more combat effective. Or something crazier like arachnid limbs or Doc Oc tentacles."

11923,"I dunno, out of all the parts that have been animated I think part 4 is the best executed overall. Part 5 has better visuals and SFX, but the story in part 4 is better and the OPs/EDs are far and away the best out of all the parts.

11925,Yikes this story keeps getting worse.. I doubt the astros fire him since they can’t even apologize in their statement about the situation smh
11926,"It didn't matter if she did know he was coming. He came in pretty fast and she was still waiting on her cloak cooldown, which only came off cooldown (we know this, because we see her exit cloak 6 seconds before he arrives) a moment before hammond came in the room, blocked the door with his huge ass body, and prevented her from possibly escaping without being seen.

There's no way she could have done what you described, she simply didn't have stealth available until he was right there.

From there her best bet was to wait a second and try to slip past hammond (since there's no way in hell she'd win a duel with him, especially with him standing on the healthpack and with her cloak once again on cooldown if she decided to fight him) which was only shut down because he decided to blind ult the room."

What he describes is more what you *think* ultra-low-elo would be like, but it it's actually just as toxic as any other league. You wouldn't think it's possible for someone in B5 to think that he should be in gold or high silver at least and blame their teammates every game, but in my experience at least 30% of them think that."

11980,I know this might be controversial but when did the rule change so that when there is contact there is automatically a foul? I mean Lindelof clearly grazed Origis shin but was there really enough in it for a foul? Origi went over like it was a two footed flying tackle to the knee. Just my opinion but not every bit of contact should be a foul.
11981,"Im not sure where but its said that Aerys liked Tywins wife a liiiiiiitle too much. There are 2 common theories ive heard, the first is that one or both of the twins are Aerys', the next is that Tyrion is the one thata Aerys'. Either way, it wouldnt have been consensual"

You will get a mythic keystone for a certain dungeon after doing a normal mythic dungeon, thats used for m+. The bossess also dont give loot, it is instead given in a chest after finishing the dungeon. Plus you dont just have to kill bosses but a certain amount of mobs as well. All in all it might sound a bit scary if youve never done one but its not. 

The loot given increases based on the difficulty of the key if lets say normal mythic gives a 100ilvl item
+1 - 105 /
+2 - 110 / 
+3 - 115 / 
.
.
.
+10 - 150ilvl item and so on.

It’s a great way to get items if youve hit a wall. After doing mythic plus you will also once a week get a chest in your faction hub that will give you items and other stuff based on the highest key youve done that week. 

Hope that helps. Cheers."

12048,"Hard to answer without a bias tbh, but I'll try.  I think Tierney is better than Robertson, and I think once he gets up to speed in the Premier League, he'll show that.  Tierney is unquestionably a better defender than Robertson imo.  They're both excellent going forward however, but in different ways.

Tierney loves going at the opposition right back, watch him on 1v1 situations. He gets the ball, faints to go right and then drops the left shoulder and just flies past his man.  He loves driving in to the box and then cutting it back in to or around the penalty spot/edge of the 6 yard box where the space is, as usually people expect a ball right across the face of goal, I'd say this is something of a trademark of his as I've seen him do it so often.

He's defensively very sound as well.  He's quick, strong in the tackle, can stand his man up well without going to ground too easily.  Honestly 25 million is a bargain."

We can as a society can say that overly sexual public acts are not ok, but if we have a problem with overly sexual acts by gay people then that's homophobia not an issue with conduct in general.

There are plenty of Gay people that don't go to pride, dont enjoy public displays and are very conservative. So we have to decide if its an issue with conduct in general or an issue with the conduct of a subset of gay people, because if its the latter you'll find straight people are just as bad and homophobia is being hidden behind morality.

Combine that with studios breathing down your neck it makes sense they shut it down.

For whatever reason some people just seem to think that the world will stop consider things crazy as long as they remove those things from ""List of crazy shit"" which is obviously moronic, people don't judge things or people as crazy or normal based on some list of diagnosis names.

Each of his albums is unique in their own way, completely different than the last. His discography is so varied,  it has everything from reflective insightful works, to remixes and samples of songs that may have only been heard by a few thousand people in the world, to in-your-face braggodocious insane people music, to his low point where he almost died/death of his motherand fiance.

My goal isnt to convince you to like him, respect him, or convince you that hes talented. You're free to make your own opinions and opinions often differ from others.

It completely breaks my immersion as I like to take screenshots in sceneries that catch my eye but I have to spend 5 minutes doing 1nanometer steps forward until my character stops doing the idle animation right away. It also shows in the Dressing Room and it triples the time it takes me to do a transmog because I don't see what I'm doing because of the animation.

I'd like an option to disable in the Dressing Room and also limit/disable it completely in open world. It's 2019 and I believe it's time for some character customization, where we can decide more  about how our character looks and acts. And it's not like it will take a lot of developer time, I'm sure there is some very simple function/variable that determines how often the idle animation plays and Blizzard should give us access to it in some way (menu slider, Dressing Room checkbox etc)."

12285,"I don't think anyone is making that claim (that somewhere there's a zero impact power technology). 

Solar, Geothermal and Tidal Power have far less impact than Hydro in most instances. Some would argue that Nuclear and Wind are also less damaging.

Personally I think it depends on the region. Way up North in regions with permafrost and tundra, I think hydro is just fine. I think where Nuclear lands is very technology dependent on one hand and on the other requires we consider the level a stewardship demonstrated by the society that hosts it. Solar can disrupt birds if carelessly placed, pretty much EVERY technology CAN become problematic if we are careless with it... like everything else in life really!

I think we need to stop with this idea that there's one technology, one silver bullet, that will solve all our energy needs. I'm not saying you're arguing this BTW, just that I'll often see people online and in real life argue a technology by putting down the other ones.

Further nerfing her Q either directly, through Sheen, or any interaction will push her down even harder. The point of champion balancing is to balance, not to destroy.

He's an astronaut who feels like he's lost direction in life, with his divorce and now his life takes a total turn when he finds out his supposedly dead father is alive and gone rogue.

12371,"&gt;Whereas an [abbreviation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation) may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, Rd for road or Drfor [Doctor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(title\))), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as [sonar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar), created from sound navigation and ranging). Attestations for Akronym in German are known from 1921, and for acronym in English from 1940.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym#cite_note-Paris_Gazette_and_Brockhaus_Handbuch-1)

Although the word acronym is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters,[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym#cite_note-MWDEU-2) some dictionaries and usage commentators define acronym to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word,[[18]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym#cite_note-18)in contrast to an initialism (or alphabetism)‍—‌an abbreviation formed from a string of [initials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial) (and possibly pronounced as individual letters)

12377,"You can read on wikipedia the history of the Jews in Poland. Through a lot of the middle ages, roughly 1000AD - 1600AD, Poland was a relative beacon of tolerance for the Jews. For long stretches of that time, Poland became the center of the Jewish world. Lots of Jews moved there, it was a center of jewish education and religion, it was a center of both religious and secular intellectual work, Jews were relatively well-integrated in the society, they collaborated with the government, etc. Especially in the cities, Jews would have been huge proportions of the population. Like in the big cities maybe 30% of the people would be Jewish.

But there was also a lot of tension and violence at times. There could be tension over religion as in the Jews having killed Jesus, or probably more often the real tension was financial things like jews as landlords, lenders, etc, and people scapegoating them for whatever problems they had. Not even just peasants and other inconsequential people but like there could be a polish prince who owed jewish bankers money, or one polish aristocrat was fighting with another, and the latter had jewish business partners or lawyers, and the Jews would sort of get caught in the antisemitic crossfire. Also I am sure some Jews were assholes but obviously that isn't an excuse for racism.

I'm tired of typing, my point is that Poland has long histories of both tolerance and intolerance towards jews and that is the first thing to start learning about before you can learn about the contemporary situation in poland."

12380,"Almost all of those names are moderates. Pelosi, Biden, Schiff... All long-standing politicians who don't try to do anything too controversial. AOC is a very opinionated young woman who likes to call out people's bullshit. She harp on about climate change because it's real and literally the end of the world (for humans, Earth will last long after we're extinct). She called out boarder control for putting children in cages, cages where children have died due to neglect.

The one part where AOC is wrong is renewables. She, and most everyone else have bought a bit of a lie. Renewables cannot power a nation. They are unreliable, they require a backup. You would think that this would be batteries but no. For California alone if every battery in the state, including car batteries, were connected to the grid and all other power shut off, you might get 30 minutes. Batteries also have the issue that only about 30-50% of the power that goes in comes back out. When someone talk about a battery that's more efficient, at 95% or some such, that's it reaching the theoretical maximum accounting for thermodynamic loss. No, the back up that everyone installs is natural gas. It's *cleaner* than coal, but still bad to be building from a climate point of view.

Another issue with renewables is land use. They take up massive tracks of land with very little power output. They also need to be fairly far from the cities that need the power the most. This means more transmission lines and more power loss. 

When solar and wind do produce power, they produce too much. California has to either pay other states to accept the excess power or send it to ground. All of this excess power strains the grid, and then dies off in the late afternoon when it's actually needed.

The solution to all of this is easy. It's nuclear. It's a clean, safe power source that has less lifetime emissions than solar, takes up very little land, doesn't strain the grid, works all day, everyday for the entire year. 

If California, and Germany, had gone all in on nuclear instead of renewables (and natural gas) they would both have grids that are 100% carbon free and they would have cheaper electric bills instead of some of the highest in the world.

12423,"(Copied from another time I answered this question, sorry if that's not allowed): 

During the worst periods of depression, I made decisions that would be sure to change my environment and surround me with different people and experiences. I took jobs overseas in places I dreamed of vacationing, and worked at a summer camp where we lived very close to nature. Anything that cuts you off from your depression-afflicted lifestyle for a period of time and gives you exposure to the possibilities is a good start.  


Emotional Support Journal for venting, knowing myself, answering my own questions about what caused depression and why, proposing trial and error of what could be done or thought instead, forcing myself to write (and therefore think about) funny things and gratitude, etc. when it gets too heavy. This is conscious reprogramming of your brain if you go at it persistently and honestly. You probably have a very real, logical reason behind your sadness. Maybe you can do something about it and maybe you can't, but at least try to know what it is and how you can change it or cope with it.  


I learned to live without asking other people for help (especially money) too much, and found a need in society that not many people were willing or able to fill. The feeling that people needed me - and the helpful salary that went with it - was essential to my survival and recovery. My mind told me I was horrible and evil and the worst...so it was important to culture evidence against that: ""But I'm contributing! I helped someone! Now if I don't keep helping people they will actually not be better off without me!"" for example. Talk back to bad thoughts! They're loud but there are totally flaws in their logic.  


Medication. At the worst time of crisis, a mood-flattening antidepressant helped because feeling nothing was better than feeling tortured by my own mind to the point that death sounded peaceful and appealing. But in times of non-crisis, I had to medicate in other ways because I hated never feeling happy. This is how I learned: I wasn't that I had depression; it was just that I felt everything, happy and sad, in an intense, more protracted way than it's necessarily easy to handle. Accepting the good with the bad became a long-term endeavor...and a hard-won accomplishment.  


Fun medication. I look for opportunities to do things that are ""opposite"" the horrors of life in my opinion, so something nice happens a few times a week: Ballet class for adults. Swimming. Walking in the woods. Drawing. Happy hour, even (but keep a tight rein on alcohol or other substance-based fun - if you're enjoying some it's good, but if you're depending on it it's bad). Constructive, reality-based activities where you can be surrounded by beautiful things and/or like-minded people with whom to participate in a community. These are necessary activities. These are to be taken seriously as medicine. If you don't feel like it, do it anyway at least once in a while. Life can't just be feeling like shit, work/school, sleep, passive entertainment, repeat. Do stuff that gives you something back.  


Proper hydration and nutrition. The biggest change towards my recovery happened when I dated someone who ""made me"" take vitamins and drink water. I was the kind of depressed person that would have no appetite most of the time. I know depression doesn't come from something as simple as diet, but maybe on some level your brain chemicals don't do their thing the right way when they are missing the fullness of the water and nutrients they need. I'm not a doctor, but this made a huge difference for me: I had more energy, slept better, my skin got gorgeous of its own accord, and I felt more resilience to the assaults of my demons. (I'm speaking of the mass-produced drugstore brand vitamins bought at the BOGO 50% sale our drug store does every other week; good health doesn't have to be elitist).  


When someone hurt me before, I used to blame myself and want to join them in hurting me worse by examining all the reasons I deserved it. Now when someone hurts me I turn it outward on them and understand them to be a crusty foul troll that needs to crawl back under the bridge it came from. Other people are accountable for their own actions, and many of them actually have shit for brains. Stick up for yourself, even if only in your own head.  


Loving yourself isn't a state of mind or a scintillating epiphany. It's boring work. It's prioritizing things like getting enough sleep, shelter, water and food. It's knowing what you need and how to get it. It's getting your shit together as you grow up so you don't just end up in some life you hate that you had no control over falling into. It's recognizing that the world is absolutely awful but it can be just as beautiful as it can be awful, if you hang around long enough. It's thinking less of people who hurt you and moving on without toxic people. It's setting boundaries with the people in your life - you can be nice, but don't tolerate being abused or taken for all you're worth. People who say bad things about you are usually wrong. ""Be kind to yourself"" and ""accept yourself"" never made sense to me, either (what if I'm a murderer? You want murderers to accept themselves? Like you do you! You murder those schoolchildren because it's who you are! Ugh) I consider sentiments like that very soft-minded. We grow until we die and we are all works in progress. Effort and actions are underrated but they will get you further than cheap positivity. Want to love yourself right now? Go drink a 16oz bottle of water.  


tl;dr: Some concrete actions that helped me beat depression (actually, live with being prone to depression) followed by an observation that loving yourself is not the panacea that will forever redeem you. Loving yourself is in ordinary actions and choices we make every day. They add up."

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, reddit censorship is such a know commodity at this point, it's hard to really get up in arms about it.  They ban or quarantine subs they don't like for things very large subs do much more regularly.  Reddit has shown their political preference...and that will continue until they finally drive people to a new platform.  There's just not much discussion to be had about reddit's censorship problem.  They run this site with an iron fist, and the majority for teenagers who use this site don't see the dangers and they like being shielded from speech the news has told them was wrong and hurtful.  That, and the fact I've bitched about reddit censorship for the past 5 years...It's apparent they don't care what users want, they have completely ditched their original mission statement.

But, it definitely seems that Disney is exploiting it. 

One show in particular that comes to mind is that show that had the one kid come out as gay in an episode. 

Maybe I’m looking at it wrong and they are just trying to introduce an environment for younger generations in which they are accepted no matter their gender or sexual preference?

12547,How tf wasn’t that a yellow?!
12548,"&gt;They're not trading actual physical orange juice, they're reading shares of companies that are a part of the supply chain in producing and selling orange juice, right?

In this case, they're selling commodity futures, not shares of any particular company. They are actually selling physical orange juice - they just don't have it now.

&gt;In the first period that akyroid and Murphy were selling (knowing the price would drop when the report came out), did they necessarily need to own the shares they planned on selling? Or is that only necessary if at the end of the day, they don't have enough shares to cover all the buy orders they made.

They don't need to own anything at this point. All they're doing is promising to sell a specific amount of a commodity at a specific future time for a specific price. How they get ownership of that volume of the commodity between the date of the agreement and the future date of the sale doesn't matter to the buyer.

&gt;So at the end of the day, they have a bunch of money (because they sold at 142 then bought at 29) and they have a bunch of orange juice shares, right? So if there was some catastrophe that wiped out 90% of the orange crop, they could turn around and sell high, yeah?

At this point, they don't actually care about the orange crop, or the market price in April, because they have agreements with a bunch of people to buy the commodity cheap (as low as $29) and different agreements with other people to sell the same amount high ($142). 

If the market price come April is actually higher than their $142 agreement, they still have to sell at that price, but that doesn't matter much because they're still buying at $29. In all likelihood, they won't even have the contracts by April - they'll sell both the buy and sell orders to the buyers and pocket the $113 difference."

12601,"Do we have better healthcare in Canada?

My wife and I work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week plus weekend overtime with kids. When my wife sprained her ankle and we couldn’t make it to the walmart walkin clinic in town because it has Bank hours. I had to talk her into going to the local emergency room to verify if it was just a sprain, because we are constantly told not to bother going to the ER unless you are dying. It was a bad sprain and I was worried and had no good options. . The Doctor in the ER was pissed that we came in and then proceeded to fake cough all over my wife and me. He was belligerent and rude. All we wanted was an ok its good go home. But nope. He was a dick and unprofessional. That is pretty much the normal response from some Doctors and some nurses. We don’t have a family doctor and rely on walkin clinics and ER. 

I would have paid out of pocket for a little consideration. I know others are sicker and need more attention and I accept that we would be the last seen, but to be treated like less than human or insulted is par for the course in Canada. 

As for Healthcare in Canada I am a 43 year old working male that pays taxes and has never had a physical or has a doctor and only goes to the hospital for broken bones and when I am about to die I will be admitted to some ER to most likely be transferred to the morgue or a hospice because I get First Aid in Canada, not healthcare. 

Sounds a lot like America to me but hey free stitches, If I don’t count my taxes. 

FYI: I am acutely aware that some folks get great healthcare in Canada but those lucky ones don’t realize how many unlucky ones there are in Canada."

12639,"This is a stretch. For one thing, isn't the fight going the opposite way in the other introduction to Stormheim? Unless I'm remembering the Horde version way wrong, Nathanos and the player have Genn on the ropes before the crash in their questline. So it's not like this outcome is some kind of definitively established canonical touchstone so much as a tedious and deeply stupid railroady miniboss fight  that served no real narrative function, much like every other part of the entire zone of Stormheim. I'm pretty sure nobody wrote that questline thinking ""this is a good way to give players a single, definitive answer to the question of whether Genn or Nathanos is a ruffer and tuffer dude."" 

Second, I feel like Greymane is about as much of a ""regular Worgen"" as the various Saurfangs are ""regular"" orcs. On top of that, the player character is a pretty big variable. At that point they're wielding some crazy artifact like the Ashbringer and responsible for the deaths of a bunch of demon lords and old gods and inexplicably powerful troll dudes nobody had heard of until like a week before they were a bigger threat than all those demon lords and old gods. A ""regular"" orc with an artifact type weapon was able to lightly wound Sargeras. A ""regular"" worgen aided by an extremely skilled and notable hero wielding an artifact weapon was able to seriously wound Nathanos. So what this scene mainly establishes is that Nathanos is somewhat less durable than Sargeras. This is not exactly a shocker, and puts Nathanos in a bracket that includes roughly everybody but Sargeras and maybe some of the Old Gods.

Third, the conclusion you're trying to present as absurd isn't even that out of line by long-established in-universe standards that everyone who complains about this just goes out of their way to ignore. Again, an ostensibly mundane orc with a magic axe was able to wound a titan; the divide between a ""regular"" person and a cosmic/divine being is way smaller and more permeable than the community overwhelmingly but inexplicably perceives it to be. A mortal, mundane warrior has a more limited scale of impact than most magic-users, in that Nathanos can't like lift up or freeze an ocean with his arrows or whatever the way Jaina can with her woowoo powers, but when it comes to an actual fight between the magical or even divine and the mundane, the mundane is at the very least broadly competitive. Druids way weaker than Cenarius can tear through oceans of full-blooded demons, but some random orcs hopped up on demon blood managed to take him out. 

I play both factions and I don't really have any investment in who ""wins"" what (except I want Mekkatorque to get better, pour one out), the faction conflict narrative is contrived far past the point I'm able to get invested in it. I am, however, constantly annoyed at how little sense the outrage at Nathanos holding his own against Tyrande actually makes in light of the long- and consistently established in-universe standards of the text. At best it's disingenuously cherry picking a lone example of deeply fluid power dynamics as though it's an outlier, at worst it's a totally baseless criticism that actively misunderstands and misrepresents the established facts of the text in order to perpetuate an adverserial and fractious narrative."

The boomer generation has benefitted from their parent’s and grandparents’ exceptional frugality and purpose driven work ethic.

They have parked their wealth in multiple properties using debt swaps to further avoid taxation and as a result, driven up prices to unsustainable levels.

And they have the audacity to laugh about Avocado toast like they ever actually sacrificed. Their parents were alive during at least one world war and likely the Great Depression. The boomers have had the longest and most comfortable progression the western world has ever known. Their care-free living with minimal effort has taken so much and ignored any of our real problems for decades."

Well, depends on who the people are. Ireland definitely remembers the targeted famines under British colonial rule, which had a similar death toll to the Stalinist famine in Ukraine. Even today, the Irish population hasn't recovered."

The director intends to cut the film in such a way that it will seem like one continuous shot but that does not mean it actually is one continuous shot. Birdman is one such film. What I gather from this video is they have multiple locations, some of which they shot at separately on a different day but cut into the film in such a way that you wouldn't be able to notice it's a cut.

I'm also interested to know which shot is the longest and how many takes of it the did. If anyone is interested, there is a German film called [Victoria (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4226388/) that is actually one complete take with no hidden cuts (over 2 hours). It's really well made and I'd highly recommend it."

Land is finite and developers aren't going to build so much that they undercut their own profits.

This is increasingly not the case. As an example, the devolved Welsh government directly answerable to the Welsh people intended to bring in a law to increase alcohol prices to improve public health.

Portugal, however, used an EU mechanism intended to protect the single market in order to block this Welsh law from being enacted, for fear of the impact on Portuguese exports to Wales.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-48675251

This is not an acceptable relationship and only *one* example of the many ways in which British sovereignty is infringed upon by the EU.

The UK government sends one commissioner to the EU. They are not elected by the people and can be dismissed by the unelected president of the commission. The UK currently sends the Security Union commissioner, a role only created in 2016. Big whoop,it has a limited impact on the EU and in any case UK commissioners do not look out or further the interests of the UK over any other member state in the role as commissioner."

King wants Jack to have an arc, that Wendy is a ""strong character"" and that the horror is more conventional. He just wanted to have a more traditional story. I think Kubrick's approach is much more interesting."

People need to stop blaming others and look at wtf theyre doing wrong themselves, if youre literalls just standing in the choke for 2 minutes straight and not pushing in as reinhardt youre doing something wrong, dont expect the dps to get a pick for you to go in, you go in to enable picks

In that segment he was talking about how their work had effected others. Just listen to his tone: ""people were taught the value of family with Dragon Maid, people were inspired by Kumiko's journey in Sound Euphonium"" with narration that's heartfelt and passionate. Then he just dejectedly memes on K-On and sounds like he's bothered talking about it but only does because he feels obligated to mention it, I guess we weren't moved because of heartfelt messages, detailed animation, or relatable characters like all the other shows, just cute girls and tea. Not only is it disrespectful to the fans who were deeply moved by the show, but also to the creators who poured just as much effort and care into it as every other show he mentioned with far more enthusiasm and less memes. This isn't about his personal opinion, he doesn't have to like it but he can acknowledge it's value and effect with the same enthusiasm, knowing how it's just as beloved as anything else."

I was erring somewhere around point 2 for sure, but everything else was a bit shady for me. I mean, I honestly do see Antifa as... going about things in the wrong way sometimes, but I do agree that I've yet to hear of any deaths attributed directly to Antifa (or rather, the various groups that subscribe to its ideals) and that, while still counter-productive to the ends I think they want to achieve, their methods of protest and occasional not-so-violent-but-still-violent outbursts are no where near the same league as a shooting or bombing or what have you.

I for one was enraged with Gurriel’s actions towards Darvish. I felt personally attacked, and it’s probably because I grew up having my peers do that slants-eyes gesture towards me, telling me I look funny, and essentially reducing my entire existence down to the shape of my eyes, for a large part of my childhood.

It's not supposed to be an in-depth political argument, because music is an awful format for that, which explains why those other bands trying that are ignored.

It is after all about *raging* against the machine, not *debating* against the machine. If you put it under a microscope in a sterilized environment, then no wonder it's dull, as you've removed a core part of the band.

Similarly with film, the only difference between excellent acting and terrible acting is how you act the lines given to you. RATM was always more about stage theatrics."

For example: in MoP, they revamped every spec to use an ""active"" mitigation style where you are constantly managing your primary mitigation resources (currently ISB/PB for monk, SB/IP for war, SotR for paladin). More revamps have happened since, but the way that tanks are played on a fundamental level is different from how they played in wrath or (aside from BDK) cata."

Allied Races don't appear as a selectable option until you've unlocked at least one.

Yes, you have to unlock them. No, they're not difficult to unlock, just tedious. 

You've got the Legion batch - Lightforged Draenei, Void Elves, Highmountain Tauren and Nightborne - with their own caveats (Alliance character with Nightfallen exalted? that's okay, just have a 110 Horde character to the unlock quest on).

And you've got the BFA batch - Zandalari, Kul Tiran, Mag'har Orcs and Dark Iron Dwarves - that are less lenient (no cross-over reputation (unless you faction change) or achievement carry overs)."

They dont look to see if they are marked or who's making runs. They don't keep their head up. They only ever do 2 things - pass the safest option or lob the ball down the pitch.

It makes zero sense and its worrying we're nearly 10 games into the season and we have no game plan, no set 11 and we're completely demoralised."

13061,?? Most of the skins are absolutely not reworked from their other games. A significant portion of the Legendary skins are made via in-house brand new concept art + then being outsourced for 3D creation.

The only benefit that i can think of when it comes to 3D is that you can reuse models (assuming you stick with one set of clothing). But for everything else its resource intensive such as creating a competent background setting, good lighting, movement animation, camera placement, etc. Not to mention that most productions (and fans) want their anime to look like the 2D anime aesthetic. 

In 2D animation you could simply draw some pages, layer it with the background, colour it, and you got a scene already.

Also, i think you know that Disney is a multi-billion dollar company that can afford to throw tens or hundreds of millions of dollars into an hour and a half long animation. So thats not a fair comparison. Heck even Toy Story is around 30 million, and years of time of production. And even toy story took decades of development time to make people look alright for toy story 3 and 4.


That said, we do have 3D being integrated into anime. Ufotable uses 3D models, effects and camera work for its animators as reference. Mecha, and machinery in anime tend to use 3D."

The people they would want to distract (liberal Dems) weren’t the people who were distracted though. It was mainly conservatives and Fox News (lead by Hannity) that were interested in the case. 

&gt; Furthermore, the weird relationship between attacking wall street on the campaign and buddying up with them in private is cleanly hidden

Honestly I don’t think it’s true to say that relationship is hidden, and anyway Seth rich getting killed didn’t do anything to make it less open.

She didn't care about them as anything other than servants, obviously, but she did still save their lives. I was frustrated in the Nazjatar quest where we get our elf quest companion investigating the history of the zone and interacting with Aszhara, because they portrayed the pact with N'zoth as an unambiguously evil action, even Aszhara gloats about how evil she was, when really this is one of the few things she ever did that should be considered good, even if she did do it for the wrong reason (not that ""save my life"" is a particularly bad reason even ignoring that the highborne were also saved)."

13330,"I totally agree with you, however imo a greater problem for lower ranks like mine (gold/Plat) is that blizz balances the heros according to the playstyle in the owl. Cause let's face the reality. The money is made in the owl and not some thousand players who buy some accounts. The whole thing lately of buffing dps was to end goats in owl. Goats, however, has never even been a thing in lower ranks. In fact I have seen only 2 games ever in my rank where one team played goats an these were 6stacks. Imo games, qp and comp, got extremely annoying at the point they introduced the new 'healers'. So even if u manage to get one healer in a game it is often a Moira that just doesn't heal but fades into the enemy backline, does a little damage and then dies. Don't get me wrong I know she has to deal damage to reload her healing ability but most people play her like a dps cause it works here. These no aim healers with that high damage potential break imo the idea of a healer. Additionally, as a tank main I can tell u it is a PAIN to play against all these dps. Therefore many people just don't play tank in the first place. I mean with the hero changes lately and almost no healers I became next to impossible to play tank in any way. If the enemy team in these ranks has e.g. cree, reaper and maybe a symm or bastion on top there is absolutely nothing u can do about that. And anybody who has played one game in gold can tell u that this combination isn't by far that rare as it may sound to a higher ranked player.
Anyway, I really don't like people who play dps all the time but I understand why they do that cause most options are just extremely frustrating to play if only one player in the team is unwilling to adjust. If u get a brig solo heal and 4 dps u just can't play tank cause u know the match will suck. OW has many more problems than just some smurfs (which are a huge problem down here, I know) but the game generally favors dps players. Of course it is way more interesting to watch a nice quadruple nanoblade but owl and gold are more then worlds apart when it comes to skill, attitude and communication etc pP. The selfishness of most players just ruins so many games cause OW really depends on team play but most of these people just don't get that cause THEY want to be the one that shows up at the end of the game. Smurfs are just the same as the ones that are instalocking dps."
13331,Always. How is that a question?
13332,"If they cared about the game (they don't), they wouldn't be saying that.

They say it out of spite because they've become disillusioned with the game.
They say it because they *want* the game to die so they can be *right* to others and proclaim how they *called it*.

If they cared about the game and were worried it was dying, they'd be playing it and watching OWL (not really, just putting it on mute and running in the background), and actually speaking positively about it, not saying it's a ""dead game."""

The point of teaching arithmetic these days is so students understand what their calculator is doing, not to be able to quickly do it.  Sure it's a *handy* skill, but *necessary*? Fuck no.

I teach calculus, and don't give a damn if my students can quickly solve integrals or take derivatives (again, calculators can do it.  And you know what?  The functions they'll run into in the real world will be given by massive databases of data points, and then the computer will use numerical approximation methods to do the calculus).  What's important is the reasoning, and my opinion is that the only reason to teach *any* mechanics at all is so they have toy examples to play with to get a better understanding of what's going on under the covers."

13436,"The EU territorial integrity that was expanded artificially over Cyprus.

EU lost all rights to a moral high ground when they accepted Southern Cyprus as a full member during unification negotiations AFTER the South refused the UN mandated plan of action. As a reward for the nonconstructive approach they were accepted into the EU. Accepting them into the EU meant Turks in the North had a long but slow death as the only option left as there is 0 incentive for the South to seek amicable solution to the current issue; they already have everything they want. And today EU is acting like a bully saying not only does the South posses every single point of resource in and around the island but that they will act aggressively if otherwise challenged and you among others in this threat are playing the war drums eagerly hoping for death destruction and ethnic cleansing.

There is no difference between Russia slowly creeping into Georgian or Ukrainian territory and attacking, threatening and bullying those countries for approaching those borders. Russia (with the support of the majority Crimeans) annexed Crimea and has defence systems active there and arrests ship crews from Ukraine that approach there. The minorities such as Tatars in Crimea had no say in this and have no rights to the resources or benefits that land offers today; exact same situation to Cyprus and the EU. 

Turkey has started to see through this facade of morality, human rights and other high minded ideals that the West tries so hard to attribute to itself. When they talk about minority rights in other countries the images of the Catalan voters being smashed head first into pavements as they are dragged away from the poll boxes by militarised Spanish police and the non-existent response from the glorious EU is remembered. When EU talks about Cyprus state rights, international law etc. the fact that Cyprus and even Greece were fast-track approved as members with massive issues (border dispute and economic hardships that were blatantly lied about and hidden).

You can negotiate with Russia or Chine (less so with US) because they do not feel the need to hide behind ideals of being the supreme moral authority on earth. EU sees it fit to expand her borders and then demand respect and recognition of those borders from the country that has the most coast line in the Mediterranean where the area is concerned.

The EU can do whatever it wants but at some point her citizens must face the fact that its just another imperialist power that is trying to gobble up the last vestiges of fossil fuels left on this earth and the moral fairy tails it tells itself are seen as the bland lies as from the rest of the earth. US has shown with the Trump admin's honesty their true nature from Iraq war to now wanting to take on Iran and being a bully in international relations/trade, Russia and China are always open and honest about their pragmatic soft power nature and EU is while still spouting the empty propaganda of rights, morality etc. is finally acting like the resource hogging two faced, double standards bully it has always been."

Her ult charges quickly do not be afraid to use it liberally.

Orb usage depends on situation, for example if you have full ult charge and your team's isn't fighting, don't throw dps orbs into the other team, all it does is charge enemy ults.

You want to use healing orb during the outbreak of a fight and during the periods your left click needs to recharge.

You’re out in the field looking at a survey from way back. Layout your metric plan onto that. Oh wait, the surveyor used 10ths of an inch.

Okay so you’re ready to dig out a trench for pipe to 2m deep and 1 m wide. Need to fill it back in? How many yards of stone do you need?

So now you’re testing the pipe, have to figure out the pressure on the bottom of this structure. So you look at the shop drawing in meters. How many PSI is it experiencing?

Okay so you are building a road on top. Take your shots, get your elevations from the plans and specs in meters and millimetres. Tell your operator to build it up. How many more inches?

When the game ended they apologized and said I was actually a good shot caller and gave me an endorsement.  I actually had a laugh about it. A lot of people are mean just cause they think it is cool. I know it is hard, but try to not pay attention to the bad guys. Focus on your personal skill and game and zone out everything else. Even when I lose 5-6 games in a row I know I have done my best.

Not completely. Different countries &amp; companies have different rules regarding what could and could not be faulty. There was an incident with ALM Flight 980 in which the faulty PA system was known but according to company guidelines still tolerable since they had alternative means of communicating with the cabin crew—unfortunately, in this case, the cabin crew was staffed by a separate company and did not understand the cabin signals the pilots used and contributed to the severity of the accident. I know this is an opposite example but this points to the fact that faulty system, even as vital as the PA, could be tolerated. (Probably not the case nowadays, but still, flights do take off with faulty systems as long as it's still considered safe enough.)"

They would be expediting their own overthrow. Also the military is outnumbered 9:1, and the military itself would fracture into factions if ordered to bomb its own cities so guess what, we got tanks and drones too

&gt;There is absolutely no reason for civilians to own military-style weapons

Or are you planning to go to another chiropractor for the rest of your life? Cause that's the only way needing that much money for a back injury could be justified. Otherwise you could do eight PT sessions and pay several hundred a pop and use your remaining disability insurance payments to buy you four new cars a year.  A major back injury could cost up to 80000, so you'd literally have to get a back injury that causes you to miss work for months and have surgery TWICE a year to justify that bullshit insurance quote. (A Google search shows that you could have disability insurance at most ages and health levels for $1500 a year, and if you're required to have workers comp it will likely be less than $5000 yearly). 

And according to a 2018 survey by Chiropractic Economics, the average cost of malpractice insurance for chiropractors is $2713.

We don't feel the need to ""nest"" anymore, we want a career and to travel etc. But children are still associated with the old way of doing things: being married, buying a house, having a stable job etc. So if we want children, I think society and government should encourage having children even if we're not married, have a house and a stable job.

Just because EU is stronger in general doesn't mean bottom teams are suddenly better than a top 3/4 team in TSM.

13839,"**2007 NBA betting scandal**

The 2007 NBA betting scandal was a scandal involving the National Basketball Association (NBA) and accusations that an NBA referee used his knowledge of relationships between referees, coaches, players and owners to bet on professional basketball games. In July 2007, reports of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were made public, which alleged that during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 NBA seasons, referee Tim Donaghy bet on games in which he officiated.On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation, and a year later he was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release. As a result, the general reaction by the media was that the NBA's popularity would be hurt by the news of this scandal.

In researching his work, I haven't been able to find a concrete answer, but if anyone knows; what's his take on this machination of reality?  Is this reality a punishment for something done previously?  It seems like it is, as reflected in many people's lives are the struggles of daily life, whether it be financial, addiction, family, or any other host of issues.  Reality as we know it seems an awful lot like a prison, whereas in the natural state of the universe consciousness is capable of creating (willing) anything into the material.  This place is hamstrung into accepting the laws of physics, and the untapped potential of consciousness, interfacing with a fraction of what it's capable of."

I'll admit as a healer main, sometimes you're not getting heals because the healer sucks. 

However, before blaming healers, know that flank DPS are usually low on my priority heal because:

1) You're fast. Zarya will take twice as long to get back to point

2) I assume your mode of operation is go in, get a pick or chaos, and retreat to health pack or behind the team shield for heals. I don't really expect you to hang out with the enemies for long.

3) Line of sight. This is a big one. Sometimes I really want to heal you, but there's a shield in my way, and I just can't shoot my heal juice at you.

4) sometimes the only spot I can heal you from will kill me. 

5) I have no idea what you're doing. While I'm happy to relocate if safe (see 4) I usually don't know if I would get value from relocating.

5) Someone picked a hero with no synergy. If your healers are Moira and Lucio, either Lucio needs to be on the save wavelength and flank with you (which is a really underrated strategy in my opinion)  or you need a Brig/Zen who can get you those long distance heals in ez. 

6) sometimes I'm dead."

what i’m getting at is that we have been duped into thinking:

but that doesn’t hold water because money is an unlimited abstraction. our resources, as animals of the planet earth, are very limited.

13930,Doc shoulda called timeout after the second open Danny Green three smh
13931,Except this is a pond?
13932,Embarrassing stuff after the red. Played into their hands completely. Sitting back letting them pass it and then hoofing it up instead of just working an opportunity until the last minute.
13933,You played an uno reverse card on the b*#ch.
13934,Lawl this comment is hilarious

13937,"It’s so stupid that everyone in the world can see the strike zone except the one person who actually needs to see it, the homeplate umpire."
13938,"Watch it and find out. \^^

Imo it's worth a watch regardless, to form your own opinion."
13939,"&gt; I can take solace in the fact this shit show will also not be canon in 4 years when the next one comes.

James Cameron didn't have the IP for the last three films, so there is a reason why the canon of this one is overwriting those films. 

Tim Miller is also a proven director, with hits such as Deadpool, and Love Death and Monsters so there is no real reason to bash this before release."
13940,"Classy.

To be fair, if he admitted the racist chants, he'd be all but sacked.  If he took shots at his own fans...All of that said, this is awful.

I wonder if he denied seeing the anti-semitism, too."
13941,"The majority of money musicians make from playing at festivals like this are through merch sales. He gets paid for the appearance, but not nearly as much as he would normally make through merch sales. Most of the ticket sales go to the organizers, not the musicians."
13942,"Further to this, unless the content is clearly unrelated to Game of Thrones, just let the up/down votes take care of the majority of it."
13943,Yet Trump is a Republican...you realize that it was in fact the democrats and who started the KKK and are still to this day the true racists in America...right?
13944,She is 100% an Arcane Mage
13945,"The dedication, haha."
13946,Looks like it was tipped
13947,"if only media was actually held to fines or crippling lawsuits every time something like this happened, they'd probably stick to well researched news out of fear of eventual bankruptcy"
13948,"You can't fool me.

Head to r/finlandconspiracy for the truth. Wake up sheeple!"
13949,That was such a beautiful display of CS from Vitality. French CS is finally back. I love it.
13950,yeah you cant do that landy
13951,"Overheard some people today just talking about how the lions just seemed too real, and if you look around on Reddit you'll find people who find it off-putting. I've seen a few trailers and it doesn't look bad to me but I don't find it appealing in itself."
13952,You can behave however you like regardless of sexuality. Your personality is completely independent of what gender(s) you decide you want to have sex with.
13953,Booooo the Flames! Flaming Snot Donkeys.
13954,"those were 3 very good sliders bregman just took on, rainey is pitching better than ""7 balls in a row"" sounds"
13955,"It kind of reminds me of the ending to Lovecraft's *Call of Cthulhu*. Several people are killed by Cthulhu, but then some end up just...outrunning him? And the dead city R'lyeh ends up just sinking back under the ocean and the narrator is like ""Well, I suppose he's still out there. Or maybe he's sealed up again for now.""  I love the uncertainty there. 

I really \*really\* hope that we don't end up fighting N'Zoth this expansion. At least not directly. He works better as a malevolent force who's working behind the scenes."
13956,And we hate Roger for it.
13957,this is so incredibly Karmic for this reporter shenanigans
13958,His n hers had been nominated for the mercury music prize. To say if a band hasn't had hit single means people wouldn't know who they were would lead to Led Zeppelin being classed as a minor rock group with a reputation for being ok live
13959,"You are nitpicking an obvious flaw that everyone in and above grade school could notice and understand, just to justify your salty behaviour. It does more harm than good regardless of your intention."

13961,"Talking about TDs scored, not passing TDs."
13962,"With the complete absence of proof to suggest otherwise you can be reasonably sure. You would certainly want to conduct at least a couple of test fires to make sure your devices don't just fizzle, as implosion type weapon does need pretty damn precise timing on the explosive lenses.

If you're going instead to step straight up to thermonuclear rather than just nuclear that's another whole level of complexity on top, and you're pretty much gauranteed to want to test it before you fire off a warhead that just fizzles with only the primary stage popping off in a shower of neutrons."
13963,Yes and no. Since the sister team rule that has been the case - but SSO played in a group that didn't include Royal because Royal got a seed into quarterfinals.
13964,anyone else's Hulu bugging out?
13965,"The NFL's rule book states that: “For competitive reasons, no player may change his uniform number once the regular season begins.""

Edit: they do allow switches during traded on occasion."
13966,*ESPN wants to connect with you on LinkedIn*
13967,Yeah my family GP in Kamloops retired 10 odd years ago. We've never been able to find a replacement.
13968,"I get where you are coming from, but I'd rather a fight be cut short than a player fall back and hit his head off the ice with no bucket on"
13969,Can I offer you an egg in this trying time
13970,both are correct in intent but yes it's a trademark. Ivanka lacks the brains to be an actual inventor. Such brains cant be installed with mere plastic surgery.
13971,I mean you just spam q on the wave and bam you are six...
13972,loaded question haha. I placed bronze level 25 on ps4 and climbed to plat. I dont play a lot of comp anymore on ps4 I mistly just qp with friends. I havent done placements on pc until im confident in my mechanical skills because I dont wanna make the same mistake I did on ps4 haha.

13979,"From my limited testing, it seems that if you quit the match after 2 minutes and then close Overwatch, wait 10 seconds, and launch it again the bug won't happen. 

If anyone else wants to test it and report back please do."
13980,"Do you mean how the mp3 popped the CD driven music bubble? That would be a title closer to what actually happened. File sharing was just the natural reaction to the poor selection of music presented by big box music stores. Plus MP3s shifted popular consumption habits from people primarily buying albums for $10, to singles for $1.
Of course such a shift in behavior resulted in the industry bleeding.

Stop blaming file-sharing for the industry’s ineptitude at adjusting to modern technology and mediums."
13981,They are listed in order of purchase
13982,Neither.  I remember a video just like the Gus Johnson video on collegehumor like 10 years ago.  And I'm sure even that wasn't the first one.
13983,"1- there's no friendly fire here, calm the fuck down

13989,"Casino Royale (2006)

The first time seeing in in a few years, it remains both my favourite Bond film and occupies a solid spot in my top 10 of all time."
13990,"I feel like we've tried not doing anything. We've done nothing for the entire existence of the game. It obviously isn't working, so surely there's no harm in trying something else. England walking off the pitch would without a doubt cause more of an impact than them staying on it. This surely can only put pressure on UEFA and FIFA to *genuinely* address the issue or risk other sides doing it.


So yeah I kind of disagree with the article. I feel like once one team are brave enough genuinely and fully leave the field it will give more confidence for other teams to follow suit"
13991,"For sure. 

And the PCP, LSD, MDMA, ketamine, cocaine, and mescaline i used to take all came for questionable sources as well.

I like to think I'm making healthier choices these days."
13992,There are literally two comments condemning stew lmao. Relax
13993,"UK government again proves they haven't a fucking clue what they're doing. 

This is a complete mess for us in Northern Ireland."
13994,"You're one of those folks with the 'Thin blue line"" flag stickers right next to a ""you can take my gun from my cold dead hands"" without irony aren't you?"
13995,I agree even if you’re getting downvoted. just sort of a tired and showoff-ish way to feign relevance
13996,Yeah maybe.. if you're Damien Lillard. Or Curry
13997,"Follow your link rabbit holes internet stranger. I'll try to ignore the fact that you linked a *Forbes* article. (Seriously....Forbes...for news on environmental degradation???) 

The linked NASA article, that they so brazenly flaunt, states that most of the ""decline"" is due to the fact that after the forests have been burned down for urban developement and farming practices, there are less fires...due to the land now being used for urban dwellings and farm lands. 

So yeah, there are less fires...because we have less to burn...because we're burning it all. 

Whoever wrote that article either didn't read the analysis by NASA, or they did and chose to cherry-pick information to suit the articles target audience. 

A FORBES ARTICLE?? SERIOUSLY?? 

Sorry. I couldn't ignore it as well as I'd thought I would."
13998,All i see is my turn.
13999,I left Portland right after legalization but before all the stores went up around my neighborhood. I am moving back soon and can't wait to walk in and purchase an edible. It's going to be EPIC and I'm going to post photos here for all to see my absolute pleasure and joy
14000,"It really doesn't work IMO. Working a character to max level is already enough of a effort that you don't need to add locking them behind repgates.

14004,The more of us that buy them the less expensive they will be.  I feel that it is like that with most things.  Volume sales create better pricing.

14012,"Riding the hot hand sorta goes out the window when you’re dealing with the franchise GOAT and a 1st ballot, all time great QB"
14013,"To add onto this. My dad was around for these songs. But if your folks didn't own the records, you didnt hear it coming up - you heard the most popular 70s stuff. Streaming gives you access, but with millions of options, you need a taste to know what you want."
14014,he is too inconsistent to be the best but im sure he could get up there
14015,He's been trained by the best
14016,"I’m always shocked by the photos parents will post of their little girls on the internet. My sister has had her girls in cheer and gymnastics for years. Some of the photos she has posted over the years have really pissed me off. She should know better. She was 13 when she got pregnant for her first child and while she has been a great mom overall, it just surprised me. We both experienced the same abuse and yet I went the opposite direction with my daughter. I have a very hard time taking her out in public when she’s dressed in tiny shorts because I worry people might be looking at her the wrong way. It sounds crazy but the anxiety is so real. I try not to let my fears take over in regard to controlling every thing she does. But damn. This is just a scary world. There is no way these parents don’t know people are using these photos for porn. The thought of someone looking at my little girl makes my blood boil. I just can’t understand these people."
14017,"*Completely* wiped my Firefox install and started from scratch, reinstalling addons and opening ~~30~~ a handful of tabs that I usually have open. Still encountering a several-minute freeze upon returning from sleep. Will probably keep experimenting with specific things to see if I can pinpoint the issue at least."
14018,Lol there’s about the same chance that the Rockets trade Harden
14019,"What's so fraudulent about forcing tax-evading corporations to pay tax? These motherfuckers are profiting off the French market but evade paying for it.

French exporters to the US sure as hell pay taxes and fees to import their goods into the US."
14020,"US uses US Customary System, and it is different than the imperial system--which is actually newer than the US Customary System. Both were based off the old English system though so they are similar."
14021,The reason you haven't seen any posts on this in this subreddit is because the mods removed them all.
14022,Do we get free tacos this year?
14023,"That was so french alike , lose gun round and win force buy"
14024,It did get play:) . But Play only lasts 15 seconds so I had to record this in Replays (19 seconds vid lul).
14025,"Clannad

14026,If they're  calling for Jewish people to be removed from the country then I don't think its that much of a stretch to call them nazis.
14027,Torbjorn has an alt fire shotgun
14028,"Why, because I'm not shilling for Iran like 90% of this sub?"
14029,That's funny I just got Flying last night and got this mount this morning... I was thinking exact same thing.
14030,"Nah, quick play... and pretty much every mode is for memeing. I want to actually *play* with my friends."
14031,"The north has a very dark culture of silence. Stuff that is totally ghastly in the south is normalized, covered up and excused. It's not just the people doing it, but the rest of the community ignoring it, because everyone knows what's going on. Honestly, it's cancerous. I have absolutely loved my time in the arctic and met some of my favourite people ever, but there is a poisonous darkness beneath it all, and it has affected me mentally."
14032,Obviously they desired his genetic material.
14033,Like Junkrat says”Brings a tear to my eye”
14034,"If companies were hiring because of merit, I would be absolutely in favor of dropping all quotas. But as long as gay people don't get hired because their prospective boss is irrationally antagonistic to them, people who sit in a wheelchair are excluded from desk jobs which they can do without any issue from their wheelchair because it is too much effort to mount a small ramp to some stairs and have one wheelchair-sized toilet stall or women don't get hired because they could get pregnant, we need to force companies to create jobs for these people as well.

Also, it seems you are one of the people that think diversity is a hand-out to disadvantaged people that is forced upon companies, which could not be more wrong. A multitude of studies has shown that diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams in almost every regard, but that is counter-intuitive to many people. So companies create quotas not because they are forced to by some outside agenda, but because they know that they have to instruct some of their managers to create the diversity that gives their company an edge."
14035,Pull out of the major. It's not like this scenario hasn't been seen before. Teams get disqualified when they don't have the right amount of players and can't use stand ins.
14036,"Also blood DK, and Holy Paladin (though the number of healer 2h swords are extremely small to the point of being nonexistent, but they can equip them)."
14037,"Yea, you def need to be in touch."
14038,"The main purpose of her hack isn't the shields, it's the grapple. That means no escape for him. He has to have a shootout with her, in which he has a MUCH bigger hitbox, less dps, a longer reload, no mobility, and only 50% more health. That sounds even to you? Again, it's clear that you don't play either character."
14039,"Sometimes i wanna wait too, but to me at least, there is much easier to catch subliminal things when watching it back-to-back. Im the kind of person that can forget alot from a episode if i watched it 1 week ago.

Try watching a series back to back one time, at least like 3-5 episodes, i promise its a whole diffrent experience and you get more invested in my opinion."
14040,they used var on the 1st goal.
14041,It would be okay if these teams met in the playoffs.
14042,Anna bae.  Although I feel like i'd hate her in person lol
14043,"I just put them in the freezer. They are undeniably better, but for some reason he has wonderful taste in women and horrible taste in knowing what chocolate belongs in the freezer, so he won't want them anyway."
14044,"Oilers can't get anything consistent going. It's partly sloppiness, but the Blackhawks have been stifling."
14045,"It is military propaganda, your serving the anti Islam ""let's blow up every muzzy in the middle east"" neo con agenda."
14046,"the line up has been each since i went basically, so i haven't thought about getting back there. the locals were awesome though and we still keep in touch with the older couple who lived in the condo beside us. granted we probably got treated really well because we were 30 year olds who went for the music not just to get wasted."
14047,Right. I cant say no to a good deal

14051,Yeah took me 4 hours in a pug to go 8/8 but it was a blast.
14052,"I mean, lets just be real here... alot of people in this comment thread saying ""Im not cheering for the astros now."" werent going to be cheering for the astros to begin with. After we beat the Yankees everyone turned into Nationals fans anyway.

The players playing the game, aside from Osuna, have literally nothing to do with any of this.

When the fans of the astros watch games and cheer for the team, they arent cheering for the front office and Im not sure Ive met one fan who has said theyre fans of Osuna - most of us wouldnt care if he was released tonight.

Im not letting some dumbass exec and some asshole pitcher ruin the fandom Ive had my whole life. Im going to cheer for my favorite team and my favorite players. Condemn me if you want"
14053,They burn it in their power stations unlike Poland who burn it in the fields

14073,"It's not about what's better to me, or about 'facts', it's about what's accepted as 'better' by the collective body of people most qualified to judge.

Doctors are better qualified to comment on a diagnosis than Tina from Kansas. But the Doctor's opinion is no more factual than Tina's, it is however based on a supporting body of evidence that Tina isn't exposed to. The doctor can also of course be wrong, and Tina can be right. But you're still not going to visit Tina for your monthly checkup.

Now clearly this is strawman because medical science is a lot more black/white than art, but the position that the body most qualified to recognise the quality of something will be the most accurate, is still principally the same.

Sight &amp; Sound create a ""once a decade"" list of ""best"" movies that only prominent figures in the industry can vote in. This is realistically as close to a list of ""quality"" as we can get."

Check the 2nd last slide of the SG1 end credits. Any season. Here's a pic of it: [https://imgur.com/qUuVLVp](https://imgur.com/qUuVLVp)   


The 2nd paragraph will say...  
*""We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of the* ***Department of Defense****,* ***Department of the Air Force*** *and* ***U.S. Space Command****""*  


Pretty weird agencies to be getting cooperation from considering it's a *fictional sci-fi* based on wormholes and aliens. Even more strange, they tend to use official military patches.

14083,"That's not correct--the law says it is an offence to be impaired within two hours of driving.  You can be charged at that point.

You have a defence at trial if you can show three things:  That you drank after driving, that you had no reasonable expectation of being breathalyzed, and that your BAC is consistent with being sober at the time of driving (which requires a *very expensive* expert witness).  

But you absolutely can be charged for being impaired within two hours of driving with nothing else going on."

14091,"Both ways are way too complicated for this specific equation.

35\*12 can easily be broken down into multiples of 10 and 2, which most people know by rote.

35\*10 + 35\*2 = 350 + 70 = 350 + 50 + 20 = 420.

I broke down 70 into 50 and 20 because for some, adding 50 to 350 is easier than adding 70 to 350 right away.

14098,no spoiler tag for one of the biggest emotional climaxes of the show?
14099,"... not sure :) 

In Dutch it's pretty similar. The word for vocabulary is ""woordenschat"" which is a combination of ""words"" and ""treasure"". And yes, schat also means ""my dear"" in Dutch. I don't think anyone here perceives the word ""woordenschat"" as ""dear language"". It is just the word for vocabulary...

It's more of a coincidence I think. It's not strange thought to use the word ""treasure"" for your ""darling"" as a slang long after the word ""woordenschat"" was invented to describe all the words used in our language. Chances are high that English used to have this kind of word too (the word vocabulary comes from French and is not the original word)"

The older gentlemen are the ones who spent their youths in the era when swimming meant going to a pool segregated by gender and all the boys swimming naked together.

Before the sexual revolution of the 60's, when suddenly everything became about sex, the notion that two naked young men might have any association with sex was simply unheard of. One of the downsides of the 60's is that nudity, in America, has become sexualized and stigmatized.

To be blunt, they are comfortable being naked in a locker room because it would literally never occur to them that anyone there thinks about them in a sexual fashion. They didn't use to be ashamed and then one day lost the shame; these are the men who grew up in a time when men were simply not taught to be ashamed to be naked around other men.

This localized phenomenon can be seen in the stereotype that Europe in particular is the land of nude beaches and men wearing speedos and women being casually topless. The American events of the 60's never occurred there, so people seeing a woman sunbathing topless simply don't assume it pertains to sex."

14151,"Westernization or localization is something done to anime to supposedly make it more attractive and relatable for western viewers. This was usually driven by the marketing department and is based on what they think that the viewers (customers) want, understand and will accept.

It has really been dialed back a lot.

For example changing the names of characters. places and things from unfamiliar Japanese names to ""regular"" western names.

Sometimes it also involves changing items in the video, like changing a Tonkatsu dinner into a spaghetti dinner (done in Doraemon).  Or changing cigarettes and cigars into candy and other things (One Piece Sanji and Smoker).

It also can involve editing and or reordering the actual scenes, sometimes to the point that the story really makes no sense (Go Lion which was hacked up to make Voltron: Defender of the Universe) Or taking two or more anime and mashing the into a new ""single"" longer anime for syndication (Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, and Genesis Climber MOSPEADA were hacked up to make Robotech) 

Speed Racer and Battle of the Planets are other examples of taking one product and changing things to the point that the original story is lost.  I bought a Speed Racer DVD set back in the day, and was shocked and disappointed that it didn't come with Japanese audio or subs, which was pretty much the norm at that time.  Instead it was the US totally jacked up version, but I digress.

Localization also happens when things go to Japan, the one that comes to mind is in Inside out, broccoli becomes green peppers, because green peppers = broccoli as the universal disliked veggie in Japan.  However, I will say that most Japanese dubs of English material is really, really good, with very little or no loss of meaning or intent.  They seem to try really hard to present what was originally there as accurately as they can.

Some localization changes are needed or necessary because things being referenced don't exist, or there is no cultural connection or reference so the things being said or shown have little or no meaning.  Other times it's done for what I think is no good reason at all.

Of course this is just what I understand and think about localization, which is what I think you mean when you said westernized.

Well, time to watch more anime..."

14236,"Uh I'm not sure, never seen one. The general guideline is to make your team comp look coherent, but you often need to switch if someone in particular is countering/making it hard for you to play and your team is not peeling. 

And by coherent team comp, I mean picking heroes that fit your team's comp archetype. If it's dive, you need heroes with good mobility to keep up with everyone (you don't want to pick Moira or Bap to heal dive heroes for instance, because they lack the range/mobility for the job). If it's bunker and you'll play around Orisa or even Rein at a more stationary spot, then you want long range heroes and you don't need mobility. For deathball it's easier to fill in, but you want the heroes with strong close to mid range game.


As for the counters well, it's very situational. KarQ has some guides in that sense, especially the videos that show how X hero interact with all others. It should give you a better idea of when and whom to switch if being countered is the issue."

14297,"nah their nerfs were on point. Played a few Yuumi games today. The first 6-7 minutes of the game you have to play conservatively with your mana instead of spamming Q every time it's on cd. After you back and then get frostfang and some fairie charms it's back to old Yuumi with the Q spam. So pretty good nerf overall.

My only gripe with the nerf is how stupid it is that they removed the mana gain from her passive. I don't really care about the fact that Yuumi no longer gains mana from the passive but what irritates me about this change is that Riot has recently just been completely removing certain parts of champion kits instead of nerfing it to a healthy state. This has been a trend from Riot games regarding several champions. Who the hell is in charge of champion balance now? Why are they completely removing parts of champion kits from champions they just reworked or released?

Honestly have never seen any balancing like this before and I've played since 2009. I don't remember a single nerf like this where they just completely remove something from a champion instead of adjusting numbers or cooldowns or ratios. It's just mind boggling how they think nerfing champions like this is the correct way to do it. You don't have to remove something from a champion kit in order to successfully nerf that champ. Just adjust numbers or something stop removing shit from the game."

14435,"Its definitely already included in my analysis lol. The boomer bubble has already started, and is expected to play out mostly from 2019-2025. However with recession coming at the same time within the next year or two, its going to get greasy... you'll have a double downward pressure on prices as the business cycle turns into a contraction cycle, marking the end of the speculative market for this cycle, paired with listings volumes increasing as boomers banking on their house paying them some retirement money start to sell looking to downsize. Once the dust settles, you'll see prices far lower than now, but you'll also see a significant amount of wealth wiped off the books as boomers exposed to equities, or who didn't time their sales correctly lose a noticeable amount of their wealth overnight. 

During this time of prices dropping, there will be some first time buyers who've been saving their money who will be positioned to capitalize on the depressed housing prices. But unfortunately if they've been saving through market instruments, there's a good chance they watch their savings shrink during the contraction, which might hold them back from having the downpayment they need. For most others though, odds are they're already so debt burdened, and their economic situation is precarious enough that they simply weren't saving toward a downpayment at all. And then there's unemployment rising during a recession that will prevent a number of people from considering buying a house. Which is why the biggest buyers in the next cycle is going to be property management companies and wealthy buyers who scoop up property for a deep discount, which will further consolidate the market. If 40% of Toronto homes are not owner occupied now, I'd fully expect we'll see that number climb above 50% by the top of the next cycle. And with negative rates on the docket for the next downturn, the asset bubble that follows is going to climb staggeringly high, since at that point you're basically getting paid for holding your mortgage once its below our target inflation rate, so deep pockets will leverage the crap out of that and we'll enter into an even bigger bubble. 

So to anyone who wants to buy property at some point but hasn't been able to yet, my advice is to aim to squirrel away as much money in savings as humanly possible between now and the next recession (which I think is likely within 12-18 months, if not less... in Canada if you exclude money laundering we're kind of already there tbh). Make sure its a form of savings that won't matter if the market turns down (so mutual funds/most ETFs would be riskier than you want to be stowing large sums away in now IMO). Then just hope you don't lose your job in the recession, and if you don't, wait out the market until prices fall to somewhere you're comfortable with, and ideally only after we see what the US Fed does in response to the recession. If they go for negative rates... find a place you can afford to carry and squat for ideally a decade at least, and lock it in. The people buying in at that point will be like the people who bought real estate in 2008.... only with even higher prices at the next top."

My average over 3 maps would be 1.3. Where as EliGE has 53 maps and has still retained a 1.3 rating, both over the same time period. Technically we are “equally skilled”, and I say that with a pinch of salt lol, however I have 50 less maps than him. In order for it to be a fair comparison we should have similar maps played and say I don’t keep up with my 1.3 rating, my 3 maps played mean nothing but that I played decent over them and not the others."

I don’t know where you fall in this, but your only solution is to climb out of gold. If you’re better than the other players in your rank, you should win about 60% of your games, and that will help you to eventually climb to Plat, but if you can find a role in a 6 stack of people from a discord group or whatever who are willing to play meta comps and communicate, then you can quickly climb SR."

If they did manage to finish conquering every continent, by then Dothraki would be spread out too thin and get overcome by vassal uprisings. Dany could only solidify her rule in Westeros with full-grown dragons, she was lucky that the original plan of invading with just Dothraki failed."

&gt;Sry buddy. What did he do that’s illegal? What did he ask for?

Glad helping you narrow this down.
By implying the entitled money would not be given unless Ukraine does it's part in Trumps interest seems like a bribe.


""Federal law [prohibits](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121) a foreign national from directly or indirectly making a “contribution or donation of money or other thing of value” in connection with a U.S. election, and prohibits a person from soliciting, accepting or receiving such a contribution or donation from a foreign national. Federal law defines contribution  as ""any gift … of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.” And the FEC by regulation defines [“solicit”](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/300.2) to mean “to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly, that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value.”""

So that's the debate. Not if *what* he asked for was illegal

They have earned their praise."
14650,"Quick legal lesson for anyone reading this comment.

In the eyes of the law a crime needs “Mens Rea” (or a guilty mind), and “Actus Reus” (the guilty act aka the commission of the crime).

(Side note not all crimes require both, but with a charge such as terrorism you’d be hard pressed to even conceive of a crime where it’s terroristic negligence)

The reason there won’t even be a discussion of charging him with terrorism is because this seems like it was a drunken idiot pulling a drunken stunt. **There was no Mens Rea** linking it with terrorism."

When you purchase something to simply exploit it. Homes are not supposed be investments. 

Foreign investors (mostly Chinese) are literally stealing land from Canadians using financial means. They must be stopped as soon as possible. 

These invaders pay whatever price to win the home and then they just let it sit or they rent it out at a large cost. They don't even live here and they're removing affordable housing from Canadians that's theft in my opinion. (while not legal theft, but I think the government needs to step in and make it so)"

14826,"&gt;Harper cut things like Labor Market Agreements and other programs the Liberals had in place before to help fund training and job creation, most of that was in trades.

True. (ish)

&gt;He then implemented his own programs that benefitted the provinces he supported and made cutbacks to other areas like DFO and scientific funding that acted as a double hit to places like the maritimes in terms of jobs, both trades and otherwise.

false. Scientific funding for example went up or stayed level under harper (depends on the year). HE forbid them to speak in public on their research but he did not cut funding. 

&gt;Then the liberals come in, get rid of those programs and implement their own, including hundreds of millions towards training that absolutely goes towards trades etc...

false. They cut - but they didnt replace. That's JUST starting now. 

&gt;Blaming the Liberals for lack of available trades people is BS as much as giving Harper credit for it, considering both killed programs for it the instituted their own programs.

Harper's worked - justin's didnt. We saw an increase in enrollment under harper, doesn't look like justin managed the same. 

My problem with justin isn't that he cut programs - as you say all gov'ts do that kind of thing. My problem is he completely failed to replace them with anything nearly as effective - and now we're feeling that pinch. 

Justin has to wear what he's done - and he's failed in this area regardless."

14832,"I'm surprised this movie is rating well with critics and audiences alike. This is a movie that definitely tried to emulate 2001, and failed at hitting the important notes.

The most important part of any physiological exploration film is the writing. The movie needs a subject to explore, and it cannot stray from it, lest it bog itself down with drudgery. Ad Astra couldn't decide what it wanted to tell audiences. &gt;!The opening's Chekhov Gun, the so called ""Surges"" turn out to be completely irrelevant.!&lt; That's almost sinful.

The main character doesn't really have a clear development path, and his decisions in-universe are questionable at best. &gt;!In particular, I definitely thought that he was being set-up as a ""mission comes first"" type of character, as they came across the Mayday signal. It might have made a more subtle connection to his father, where both are willing to kill the crew to do what they feel is necessary. Instead, we got a preview into ""rage"" on a primal level.!&lt; For something that didn't really tie-in too well with the rest of the story (nobody outside of the main character and the captain seemed to care!), the writers for this movie really missed great opportunities to tie things together.

Some of the minor details were great, discounting Hollywood physics. The idea of chain restaurants on the moon was both sobering and amusing. The lunar highway signs gave me a feeling of being back in Iceland, where you have a long and beautiful road to your destination, with almost nobody else to bother you.

...&gt;!Until, of course, we introduce RANDOM LUNAR PIRATES that appear to be there simply to introduce some element of danger for the main character and the throwaway characters with him.!&lt; Really, I'm reminded of how I used to write short stories. Characters that didn't matter and weren't referenced or necessary except for that ONE thing I decided i wanted to add. Amateurish, again.

Really, Ad Astra is a film that should have been torn apart and rewritten. There is a really good movie hidden among the extra crap, if only we were given the chance to explore it. Artificial tension and artificial characters only hamper the message.

Ad Astra is, unfortunately, a shallow movie that's not worth going to theatres to see.

I guess you are right that it's ""art"" and art is difficult, but art is the most critiqued thing in existence. The whole point of art is that people/fans connect with it and can praise/critique it. 
As well as this, a show like GoT that is a massive cultural phenomenon is obviously going to be critiqued due to the success of early seasons and the highly praised source material. It's not like this is a deep personal piece of art that D&amp;D wrote for themselves, this is something that makes money, that the fans are meant to enjoy, that people are taking time out to watch. It's kinda fair enough that people feel insulted or upset when it doesn't live up to any of the expectations that previous seasons or the source material brought.

As an aside, I like to compare it to DC comics movies. I love DC comics. I absolutely hate what Zach Snyder did to the characters of Superman and Batman. I don't think he knows what's he doing, I think he should not be allowed to work in that medium ever again and I think he deserves all the criticism for those pieces of work that he gets. He doesn't understand the characters, their motivations and he writes them like idiots. He treats superman like superman hates humanity for god's sake. That's literally the opposite of his whole deal. 
But I don't see people as defensive about Zach's feelings , even though everyone called those movies trash.. it's just interesting"

14995,"Well, individually they're obviously downgrading in top and bot, but it's not about individual prowess, but team cohesion. Misfits Premier has been playing together since the beginning of the year (Kirei was added after their EU Masters win, so not him but the other four) and towards the end of LFL Spring regular season they started playing a more 1-3-1 solo lane split push style. LIDER, as everyone knows, favors assassins and Dan Dan plays stuff like GP, Vlad, Ryze, Neeko, etc. There's a pretty iconic game from EU Masters where MSF played Rogue Academy, who were big favorites to win the tournament since they were pretty much using their current LEC team (plus they wrecked the Polish league). Rogue had a huge lead due to Neon and H1IVA feeding their asses off with Taliyah-Pantheon. Dan Dan and LIDER were able to hard carry by 1-3-1'ing the whole game.

Neon and H1IVA don't require much attention, I'd say. But I think Misfits can play around them, if needed. Neon is really good, he especially shone in the EU Masters finals. Also, he's played in the EULCS before, when UoL needed an adcarry sub. He was good, Kelsey (Moser) praised him a lot. I think he can play mages too. H1IVA is more coin-flippy as he tends to feed, but Veteran thinks he's better on LAN than online, so that's a good thing. And Misfits needs someone to engage, so he's their guy.

I'd personally go with sOAZ instead of Dan Dan, don't think he'll be able to stand up to the LEC top laners, but I can see why they're using him. He's used to the team and as long as he doesn't get smashed, I think he can have an impact in the mid to late game as he's going to be splitpushing. Yesterday they played LDLC, the best French team, and he was awesome. Really outperformed HiRit, who's Korean, as Gangplank. So we'll see."

I mean if you look at their LAN stats for 2019, its becomes really hard to argue that they even have skill left niko is the only one standing out with 1.14, rain and guardian are just below average (given 1.05 is the avg in rating 2.0) with olof specially absent and god only knows why neo was brought in.

&amp;#x200B;

Stats and skill apart I dont see any cohesion in them even Niko seems to be not giving a fuck anymore, I think they can keep the trio of niko guradian and rain but both neo and olof need to go and suitable replacements are needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Also something that wont happen coz of all the big names on the team but is somewhat inspired by recent C9 roster shuffle, keep niko kick rest bring in 4 new faces, heck just off the top of my head lets go with oskar sunny flusha and kio, you can probably make the case of keeping guardian over oskar as oskar had has personal issues same reason why he joined HR so yeah keep niko maybe guardian and bring in 3 new faces that works just as well."

15068,"Squinching is the feline version of a smile. Humans are very unusual for the amount of muscle control they have in their lower face region, probably because it’s useful for speech. Like most animals, cats have far more muscle control in their eyes, ears, and nose areas, so that’s how they convey emotion.

Squinching is similar to a smile, kind of like what happens to human eyes when we smile broadly. A slow blink is a display of calm and trust. Direct eye contact can be a sign of aggression, though cats generally seem to understand that humans are bad about this.

Still, if you meet a new cat and want to get along then try some friendly feline body language.

1.	Be quiet and don’t make sudden movements. 
2.	Let the cat approach you rather than going after it. 
3.	Instead of reaching in for petting, offer your hand and let them sniff it at their leisure. 
4.	Avoid making prolonged direct eye contact, but feel free to try a slow blink. 
5.	Offering the front of your hand can startle a cat because cats strike with the front of the paw. Try offering the back of your hand instead.
6.	Above all else, let the cat determine what they are comfortable with. Don’t pick the cat up if they aren’t ready for it, etc. Cats may be superb hunters, but they’re small enough that they still have to be paranoid about being attacked by bigger animals. Cats are naturally curious, but they need to feel safe in order to be friendly."

Blizzard's philosophy seems to be one of inclusion, so I suspect that they don't want to prevent adapter usage for those who are effectively using them to cheat their way to higher rankings at the expense of the (vanishingly small) number of less able-bodied players being able to participate in the game.

&gt; Electric Light Orchestra were a symphonic rock band which formed in Birmingham, England in 1970. The band was formed by Jeff Lynne (vocals, guitar, multiple instruments), Roy Wood (multiple instruments, vocals), Richard Tandy (keyboards, vocals) and Bev Bevan (drums). Lynne, Wood and Bevan were former members of the psychedelic rock band The Move. The band's lineup would fluctuate throughout its original incarnation, although Lynne, Tandy and Bevan would remain constant members.

&gt; They incorporated the sounds of string ensembles, vocoders and dub echos into rock songs, thereby creating a very sophisticated studio version of rock. The musical content of ELO songs often went far beyond usual chord structures, mixing pop songwriting with classical romanticism and synthesized sounds. The band claim that their music ""picks up where The Beatles' 1967 song I Am the Walrus left off.""

&gt; Formed in 1970 by Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan (the remaining members of the 1960s rock group The Move). The band used cellos, violin, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound. This was an idea Roy Wood initially had while with The Move, to take rock music in a new direction. In 1970 when Carl Wayne left the The Move, Jeff Lynne, front man with fellow Brum band Idle Race, responded to Wood's second invitation to join the line-up, with the lure of starting the new band. To help finance the fledgling project, two more Move albums were released during the recording of their eponymous first album in 1971 which produced the UK hit 10538 Overture. In the US this album was released with the mistaken title of No Answer, due to a mix-up with an uncompleted telephone call to the American label and subsequent secretarial message.

&gt; However, tensions soon surfaced between Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne. With most of the media attention focused on Roy Wood, differences in musical direction, and a disastrous first live outing, it was no surprise when the band went through the first of its many line-up changes as Wood took Hugh McDowell and Bill Hunt with him to form Wizzard. Despite the music press's predictions that the band would fold without Wood, Jeff Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan remaining on drums, bassist Richard Tandy switching to moog synthesizer, Michael d'Albuquerque on bass, Mike Edwards, Colin Walker (cello) and Wilfred Gibson replacing Steve Woolam on violin. They released ELO 2 in 1973, from which came their first U.S. chart hit, a hugely elaborate version of the Chuck Berry classic Roll Over Beethoven. After their second album, violinist Gibson was dismissed and replaced by Mik Kaminski. They also released On The Third Day in 1973, with Mike Edwards playing all the cello parts due to Colin Walker leaving the band. Later that same year saw the return of Hugh McDowell, who had jumped ship the year previous, to replace cellist Colin Walker.

&gt; In 1974 Lynne hired a thirty-piece orchestra, choir and Louis Clark, then began work on the next LP Eldorado, A Symphony, a concept album about dreams, scoring their first U.S. Top Ten hit with Can't Get It Out Of My Head in 1975. Eldorado would become ELO's first gold album.
 
After the release of Eldorado, bassist and vocalist Kelly Groucutt and cellist Melvyn Gale joined, replacing de Albuquerque and Edwards respectively.

&gt; The band split in 1983. In 1985, Lynne, Tandy and Bevan reunited and recorded the album ""Balance of Power"". This reunion was short lived and the band split once more in 1986. Bev Bevan and Louis Clark, with the consent of Lynne, toured and recorded as ELO Part II from 1988 until Bevan's retirement in 1999. In 2000, Lynne and Tandy reformed Electric Light Orchestra and released a new record, ""Zoom"". ""Zoom"" proved to be a commercial failure, and the duo split once more in 2001. Read more on Last.fm.

When it comes to characters design and facial expresion, they don't look realistic, they look very cartoonish too me. And thats why i think they look good; a real person expresions are simple and limited, a cartoonish character has much more exagerated expresion and looks more vivid.

But that's a style choice, this has nothing to do with budget. And there are plenty of anime with such type of expresions, like [little witcha cademia] (https://memestatic1.fjcdn.com/comments/I+always+refer+to+the+many+faces+of+akko+chart+_e55a2a5f7121888141017fffb9a435f4.jpg)"

&gt;The American health care system is the prime example; have a good job that requires had health care benefits? Nice! If not you're out of luck or deep in debt.

Generally speaking, if you're an adult and have a normal adult job, you have healthcare as a perk.  If you're working a teenagers job or self-employed, that's different.  One is being lazy and refusing to work to your potential, the other is a risk(all small business is a risk).  Like I said before, we have assistance for the disabled, and medical for the impoverished.  Most people who have their ducks in a row aren't crippled by surprise illness.  But there is a subculture in America, just like in Canada, where there are people looking for handouts who will do odd things hoping they can sue someone well-off.

Yeah I'm not an expert on this, but most universities take govt subsidies and hit their alumni up for cash, and books can be $200 a pop, so we might want to explore why these companies think they can charge as much as they do, before we start giving them billions of taxpayer money.  Nobody is talking about this though, the politicians just scream ""free college"" to get a certain demographics vote and it's sad to see.

&gt;Your country can do much better at helping out the least able and I think that starts with the mentality helping those less fortunate and not stepping over them. You say you have those things to help out the less fortunate but frankly, just because you say you have them does not mean they're adequate.

I think your information is wrong on how we run our country, and I blame the far left for perpetrating this nonsense on this horrible website.  Most wealth problems in this country are in leftist cities, but they aren't doing anything to solve the problems.  They're free to raise their taxes and make all the local programs they want, go and show us how it's done, but they're not doing that, they're barely keeping their sidewalks clean of needles and feces.  So I'm not really interested in hearing leftists lecture about how things should be done until they can produce actual results"

&gt;What are your thoughts regarding the EPIC Dual Flash-Step Battle between Julian and Yuuki, and how do you think Reiji and Sei will do in the finals?

The effects were really cool! You could see that they were trying to show how they were moving at high speeds while still allowing you to follow the combat, but I found it a little underwhelming how low impact the strikes were. I'd have preferred them to be a little harder hitting I guess. Tough it was still a great fight!

I think Sei and Reiji will win the finals, but it'll come down to a close range brawl after they exhaust their special abilities. It's been done a few times this series already, but it'd still be hype. I am expecting *some* kind of twist on the formula though.

&gt;Given the recent revelations from the Chairman and Nils' research, what do you think is the secret behind The Plavsky Particles and what are your ideas regarding Reiji's possible ties to this?

15377,"two reasons

One, the people in charge of WoW do not agree with what ""fun"" is. Fun is a subjective term, perhaps they think having a lot of grindy timegated content is fun - i am not being sarcastic, they honestly could feel that way. It is also possible that they are no longer ""gamers"" at heart, and thus do not know how to effectively develop games for gamers - they are bureaucrats, or managers, or accountants etc. They see numbers, they make more numbers.

Two, its far easier to add quantity than quality. In terms of goals, for investors it doesnt matter if game made $100 by making more content or by adding a 17th recolored mount, all that matters is that they made $100. So if they can predict X profit from doing Y action, they will do it. And sometimes, when you keep in mind development costs, time, etc, its far easier and cheaper to just make people stay subbed for longer than to entice them with better content (which might not work). 

All of this is my subjective opinion of course. I too would love to have my ""old warcraft"" back, not talking about Classic but about the time when WoW was actually fun to play. These days i mostly stay subbed for the story and my inability to move on from a game i spent a decade playing - but i quit raiding, quit farming, quit grinding, i just... mess around i guess.

Those in the top 1 percent of the income distribution (any family making $394,000 or more in 2015) provide about a third of all charitable dollars given in the U.S. When it comes to bequests, the rich are even more important: the wealthiest 1.4 percent of Americans are responsible for 86 percent of the charitable donations made at death, according to one study.*"

wat? pretty sure judging by what you say it makes him completely different from laners, bcos he isnt a laner himself and you sure as heck arent special, fam.


junglers get blamed bcos their mistakes are more punishing than anyone elses, nobody cares if your toplaner is bot with tpp when enemy team starts baron, but if your jungler is down there in that situation you are fucked. if your midlaner is getting dove under his t1 turret bcos the enemy has a big wave and the jungler knows how to dive and your jungler is at like wolves or raptors and rather finishes the camp instead of ganking/counterganking, ofc you're gonna get flamed. if the enemy toplaner roams to your lane, at least your top laner gets free farm time, which mostly can still be usefull, especially bcos of turret platings, but if the enemy jungler is proactive everywhere while your lee sin or elise or whatever jungler it is that is supposed to do stuff early game or they are shit, is just afk farming, you should expect to get blamed.


roaming enemy lanes might get advantages, but jungle activity can make the game literally a 4v5.


dont pretend like junglers are the poor little thing that only gets blamed and never does something wrong. every jungler at least once contested a scuttle crab with lanes not having prio and died for it. they all tried to sneak drakes without prio in lanes and died bcos they got spotted, or they ganked when you were sitting under your turret early game with like 10 minions and then got bursted by the enemy and died. those are all jungle mistakes, not lane mistakes. and for every laner that didnt help you as a jungler even tho they had prio, every jungler did at least one of those stupid mistakes himself. so stop blaming anyone. but dont pretend like you play flawless and cant be blamed every either.


oh and dont worry, its not just in low elo, even in high elo you have junglers going botside, when the enemy team runs towards baron and they also often just ignore the huge minion waves or enemy dives under your turrets when they are close by. it wont get better, simply bcos junglers need to use their brain more than laners. junglers theoretically need to be the smartest person on the team, but since humanity is getting more stupid everyday, they will always get blamed."

Yet they aren't directly elected and can't be removed from office by public vote once there in power they don't need to worry to about public opinion. 

But they effectively have the power to decide what direction the EU goes in. 

You also have issues such the EU constitution which the EU tried to get confirmed by referendum in various country's, after the first 3 country's to vote all rejected the treaty they cancelled all the other referendums. Renamed it the Lisbon treaty and passed it without putting it to a referendum.

Then there are problems with the euro, where country effectively no longer have control over the own economic policy which effects pretty much every other area of policy making for national governments, which is instead dictated by the ECB which again isn't elected.  

Additionally you have issues such as the cordon sanitaire where politicians who oppose further integration of EU member states will be blocked from any senior position within the EU political structure.

You have people like martin Selmayr as who have immense power within the EU, but who gain power via dubious backroom deals.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/04/eu-watchdog-finds-juncker-broke-rules-to-promote-political-ally

The reals problem is that actually very difficult to fully understand how the EUs internal decision making process works, it is so convoluted and open to change and most decisions are made behind closed doors. Take the election of the latest EU president it was almost impossible to predicted who it would be in advance, because it was dependent on nether public opinion and the system by which they would be selected was subject to change via a complex web of internal politics.  

The EU isn't totally undemocratic but it absolute has a big democratic issues which are are very unlikely to be resolved any time soon."

15665,"My pet theory is that N'zoth WILL be the next final raid boss and he WILL be killed by the players.. and his death will lead into a void-themed expansion. 


Unless it's been retconned, there's been lore kicking around for awhile explaining that the Titans couldn't kill the Old Gods due to their extensive infestation of Azeroth. With N'zoth being the last known Old God, and assuming that we have indeed killed the previous Old Gods we encountered, what happens when N'zoth dies? 



This could be totally off-base, but going back to the Il'gynoth encounter, one whisper among many was ""At the hour of her third death, she will usher in our coming."" There's plenty theories going around that the ""third death"" could be referring to anyone including Alleria, Sylvanas, or Azeroth itself. 

Maybe the whisper is indeed referring to Azeroth, with the her first ""death"" being the Sundering, the second being the Cataclysm, and the third being.. whatever happens to the planet when the final old god, N'zoth, is killed. 


Boiled down, my theory is that killing N'zoth will trigger some earth-shattering event that will herald a world revamp and the entrance of the Void Gods as the next ""big bads."""

Allowing whatever gender all hormoned up in any league is going to be way too prone to abuse.

Think about it, you're going to allow biological men to compete among women just by modifying their genitals a bit (i know trans is more than that, but in black and white like sports rules that's about all they can really enforce).

We've seen how children get worked to the bone, ruining their body by the time they're 25, for a gold medal or 2 in gymnastics. Imagine what happens when you can put men in the women's league by (involuntarily) cutting their dick off.

That’s exactly what sansa was trying to tell Jon THE WHOLE EPISODE. The writers wouldn’t have sansa repeat the same thing over and over again if it wasn’t important. Should she have told jon about the vale? Absolutely she should have, they made it a point to have her apologize for it.

Lastly, everything she’s done the past three seasons has been for the north?? What show are you watching??

Symptoms include:

Home Care for Knee Pain

Inflammation is the body's physiologic response to an injury. In treating many types of knee pain, a common goal is to break the inflammatory cycle. The inflammatory cycle starts with an injury. After an injury, substances that cause inflammation invade the knee to assist in healing. However, if the injury and subsequent inflammation is not resolved, inflammation can become a chronic issue, leading to further inflammation and additional injury. This cycle of inflammation leads to continued or progressive knee pain. The cycle can be broken by controlling the substances that cause inflammation, and by limiting further injury to tissue.

Some common home care techniques for knee pain that control inflammation and help to break the inflammatory cycle are protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation. This regimen is summarized by the memory device PRICE.

PROTECT the knee from further trauma.

    This can be done with knee padding or splinting.
    A pad over the kneecap, for example, helps to control the symptoms of some knee injuries (an example is a form of bursitis sometimes called housemaid's knee) by preventing further repetitive injury to the prepatellar bursae.

REST the knee.

    Rest reduces the repetitive strain placed on the knee by activity.
    Rest both gives the knee time to heal and helps to prevent further injury.

ICE the knee.

    Icing the knee reduces swelling and can be used for both acute and chronic knee injuries.
    Most authorities recommend icing the knee 2 to 3 times a day for 20-30 minutes each time.
    Use an ice bag or a bag of frozen vegetables placed on the knee.

COMPRESS the knee with a knee brace or wrap.

 

    Compression reduces swelling.
    In some knee injuries, compression can be used to keep the patella aligned and to keep joint mechanics intact.

ELEVATE the knee.

    Elevation also helps reduce swelling.
    Elevation works with gravity to help fluid that would otherwise accumulate in the knee flow back to the central circulation.
    Prop your leg up when you are sitting, or use a recliner, which naturally elevates the legs. Elevation works best when the knee -- or any other injured body part -- is higher than the level of the heart.

Over-the-counter pain medicine: Commonly used pain relievers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), also play a role in the treatment of knee pain.

    These drugs directly control pain and, at higher doses, act as anti-inflammatory agents, helping to break the inflammatory cycle. Like all medications, however, these drugs have side effects.
    You should not use NSAIDs if you have a problem with bleeding or stomach ulcers or some types of kidney disease.
    Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also be used to control knee pain but does not have the anti-inflammatory properties of the NSAIDs. Still, this treatment is remarkably useful in many types of knee pain, such as osteoarthritis.

When to Call the Doctor for Knee Pain

When you are deciding whether to call the doctor about your knee pain, a good rule of thumb exists for most long-term knee injuries. If your symptoms have not gone away after trying a week of PRICE therapy and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain meds, you should set up an appointment with your doctor, physical therapist, or a sports medicine orthopaedic (bone and muscle) specialist to further evaluate the pain. This rule can also be applied to new knee injuries that are not disabling. Remember, however, that this rule should only serve as a guide. If you are concerned about the pain, you should call the doctor.
When to Go to the Hospital for Knee Pain

If you cannot put weight on your knee, feel sick, or have a fever or if your knee is red and hot, you should consider going to the ER to be evaluated by a doctor because of the possibility of a fracture or infection.

    Many fractures may require immobilization in a specific position or surgery.
    Infections need immediate attention. They can be managed but require prompt care.
    Putting off seeing a doctor may hinder healing.

Other signs and symptoms that demand emergency evaluation:

    Unbearable pain
    Pain that does not improve with rest
    Pain that wakes you
    Drainage
    Large wounds
    Puncture wounds
    Swelling, if you are on a blood thinner (warfarin or Coumadin) or have a bleeding disorder (such as hemophilia)"

I don't want a show about minorities, I don’t want to be given special treatment because I’m a minority, I don’t want to be pandered to. I just want to be treated like any other person of any other colour.

I have never met an LGBT+ person whose frustration is why they don't get special treatment. It's why they do. Why they are ignored? Why are they silenced? Erased? Ridiculed? Why that different, special treatment? Why can't we be treated with the same dignity as the rest?

&gt;
Similarly, wanna get rid of prejudice against LGBT? Stop making being one a big deal. Stop talking about it. Minorities are people just like everyone else, stop making a big deal out of it.

Yeah, no. This is low key ""all lives matter"" material. People humiliate us, delete us, torture us, bully us, kill us and you think that it's not a big deal? Maybe you are coming from a place where this isn't happening to the same extremity. But those games are not catered to you. It's for all of us.

15877,"It's not a question of knowing, it's a question of can a person easily and quickly discern the difference between a $10, $20, and $50 bill inside a wallet.  The 0 will obviously be the same on all three, so the difference comes down to the difference between 1, 2, and 5, which is extremely small.  If you think of the pips in each block as being numbered 1 through 6 in a counter-clockwise order, the numbers are represented as follows :

1 = 1

2 = 12

5 = 15

Which means that the difference between 1 and 2 is the addition of a second pip below the first one.  This one probably isn't *too* difficult (one pip vs. two pips).  But then the difference between 2 and 5 is the position of one pip being moved over a bit.  This is easy to differentiate if the bill is lying flat on a hard surface, but not so much when the bill is in your wallet and you just want to rub your thumb or index finger across it to determine the denomination.

So, instead of braille representations of the numbers, they decided to create a new system that would be easy to discern.  The $5 is a single block of 6 pips, the $10 is two blocks of 6 pips, the $20 is 3 blocks of 6 pips, and the $50 is 4 blocks of 6 pips.  The $100 is similar to the $50 but with the middle two blocks removed.  As a result, a blind person doesn't need to read the pips and be able to discern their precise position in relation to each other, but instead simply needs to feel how many blocks of pips there are, which is really simple to do."

15947,"&gt; They went there voluntarily, in concentration camps, they are rounded up against their will 

Migrants do not go to these camps voluntarily. They are rounded up and sent there when they attempt to enter the country. You're engaging in the same rationalization we see from petty bullies and authoritarian regimes alike: ""I'm threatening to hurt you if you do something I don't like, so if you do that thing and I hurt you, it's your fault you were hurt."" What you plainly really mean isn't that migrants *choose* to be detained, but that they *deserve* to be detained -- so this is the position you need to defend.

&gt;... and sent to the camp to die.

That's what happened in Nazi concentration camps, but not all concentration camps involve executions or deliberate neglect tantamount to execution.

&gt; Here they are waiting, be it in horrible conditions, to get into the United States to start a new life. 

Here's the bottom line: America is operating concentration camps for Central American refugees and migrants. These camps are not Buchenwald. Nor are they just poorly-run, unpleasant waiting rooms. They are not run by an administration set on exterminating non-whites, nor are they run by an administration which values Latino immigrants and hopes they become American citizens real soon. They are something in between these extremes. 

If the term ""concentration camp"" is upsetting to you because it evokes the possibility that something awful is happening, good: everyone should have that worry whenever a government starts rounding people up and detaining them. Now get over the fact that the word offends you, and try to make a rational judgement about what's going on. Do you think it's sometimes okay to operate concentration camps? Under what circumstances? Do they apply here?"

Ultimately, I don't know what I get from travel. It's nice, and a thing to do, but it's not really completing me as a person. I guess it can be said that I'm currently following a lot of trains of thought I first came up with in Hawaii.

Thirdly and it correlates to the first point. Tourist whom don´t know how to drive in Iceland with a mix of buses and narrow roads. We have had quite a few bus accidents the past year :/"
16064,"I will argue that the CG is not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. Toei has been doing 3D CG for a while now, and while some of the scenes suffer from what you'd typically associate with CG productions (weightlessness of the characters, lip syncing, etc), it's not terribly egregious, and there are moments where the animation actually looks more than decent. Some of the scenes where they flip from CG to hyper-stylized 'paintings' is actually really cool, but they happen so infrequently. I really wish they'd lean more into that style than anything else.

The bigger issue I think is that the writing is just bad. Plain, flat bad. The voice acting is fine and I commend the actors for doing as much as they did with the material, and no one actor (besides maybe Unicorn Jab and Shiryu--I mean, 'Long'--'s sister) are terribly grating, but condensing as much as they did into just six episodes just isn't working. The original Saint Seiya animation doesn't age particularly well when viewed with modern expectations, but what drove it at the time was the character moments. When the fights were essentially just Saints throwing attacks at each other until one of them won, the tension wasn't in the action sequences, but in the drama involving the fighters, and that drama only takes root when you have time for those characters to present themselves fully. We barely get ten minutes for every main Saint's backstory. They did a competent enough job trying to condense those backstories into the episodes they're in, but there's far too little of it to matter much. It also makes the camaraderie of the main four feel extremely contrived by the end of episode six, because it just doesn't feel very earned, despite the preceeding battle against the army and the Black Knights. 

I won't even touch on the humor. It just felt out of place and unnecessary, and Seiya in particular suffers for it. Saint Seiya is at its best when it's being a super self-serious melodrama; the concept as a whole is campy as hell, and the idea of people fighting with the power of constellation-powered myths is so over the top that you just have to lean into it *hard.* The humor feels like the writers were embarassed by the source material and tried to throw in cheap laughs to liven things up, when they should have been pushing the other way. 

Without the time for characters to build up and establish their relationships, the fights just lack any impact. The show fails at the core thesis of a battle shonen, being unable to deliver solid character moments or exciting fight scenes. Here again I feel as though the director was too beholden to Kurumada's original style. Rather than try to replicate the Attack-&gt;Counterattack-&gt;Counter-COUNTERattack kind of back and forth of the original show, they should have tried something new. Shonen anime has come a LONG way since Saint Seiya, and this was a missed opportunity to take some of those modern lessons and apply them to the classic idea. Even SS Omega, for all its flaws, at least *tried* to be visually interesting. This show felt static, bloodless, and empty, and I say that with the sadness of a fan who had been hoping for something decent. 

That said, the latter few episodes were much better than the first few, so I'm hoping the subsequent parts of the series are better. Unfortunately, it's hard not to assume the same rushed condensing issues that underpin the problems of episodes 1-6 will just persist through the end too, especially when we get to meet the Gold Saints. The original show would dedicate several episodes to each one, further cementing each Gold Saint as a phenomenal threat just by virtue of how *much effort* it takes to beat them. How in the world are they supposed to do those justice if they only have, what, fifteen minutes or less for each one, at this pace? 

Netflix Saint Seiya is poorly positioned. It doesn't offer anything to really pull in new fans, and it doesn't present the characters in a way that's appealing to old fans. I would say maybe this could have been a show to appeal to younger fans of shows like Ladybug and Cat Noir (also a Toei CG animation), but that show is *much* better than this."

&gt;A little over two decades later, America’s entry into WWII came when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, killing over 2,400 American servicemen and civilians. But far from an unprovoked sneak attack, as the official government-approved history would have you believe, Pearl Harbor is best understood as a conspiracy to motivate the American public for war by first provoking and then allowing a Japanese strike on American targets.

&gt;This is not even a controversial idea; it was commonly understood and discussed by many in the Roosevelt administration at the time. Henry Stimson, the US Secretary of War, noted in his diary that just the week before the attack President Roosevelt had told him “we were likely to be attacked perhaps (as soon as) next Monday” and then solicited Stimson’s advice on “how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.” Around the same time, Roosevelt sent a message to all military commanders stating that “The United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act.”

&gt;So how did FDR and his administration provoke the Japanese into attacking?

&gt;In late 1940, Roosevelt ordered the United States Fleet to be relocated from San Pedro to Pearl Harbor. The order incensed Admiral James Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet, who complained bitterly to FDR about the nonsensical decision: It left the fleet open to attack from every direction, it created a 2,000-mile-long supply chain that was vulnerable to disruption, and it packed the ships in together at Pearl Harbor, where they would be sitting ducks in the event of a bombing or torpedo raid. FDR, unable to counter these objections, went ahead with the plan and relieved Richardson of his command.

&gt;Then in June 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes wrote a memo advising FDR to embargo Japanese oil in order to goad them into war: “There might develop from the embargoing of oil to Japan such a situation as would make it, not only possible but easy, to get into this war in an effective way.” Roosevelt followed through weeks later with an order seizing Japanese assets in America and effectively preventing Japan from purchasing much-needed American oil, which at that time accounted for four-fifths of Japanese oil imports.

&gt;The provocations had their intended effect, and the Americans listened in on Japanese war preparations via radio. They received warnings of an imminent attack from diplomatic officials and military attachés. The attack was even predicted by the Honolulu Advertiser days before it happened. But all of these warnings were ignored. Even today, nearly 80 years after the events, new documents and memos continue to be found showing more warnings that Roosevelt and his administration deliberately ignored in the run-up to the attack.

&gt;FDR got his wish. The Japanese attack was successful: 2,400 Americans died, and the nation, outraged, responded by rallying around the flag and jumping enthusiastically into war.

&gt;But the Japanese themselves were no innocents when it came to lying their way into war. Ten years before Pearl Harbor, in 1931, Japan was looking for a pretext to invade Manchuria. On September 18th of that year, a lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army detonated a small amount of TNT along a Japanese-owned railway in the Manchurian city of Mukden. The act was blamed on Chinese dissidents and used to justify the invasion and occupation of Manchuria. When the lie was later exposed, Japan was diplomatically shunned and forced to withdraw from the League of Nations."

16161,"&gt; Yeah, but if their aim was 7 seasons all along, then decided to prolong it to 8, then it means it had nothing to do with Star Wars in the first place.

I haven't seen any credible source actually backing up that claim.

I think the reality is that they went into the project meaning to adapt an existing material, and when they had to start making their own material full on the fans were never happy. Sure, there were a few pieces that the fans liked, but those were usually adapted pieces that were changed somewhat but ultimately the same (Arya and Tywin instead of Arya and Bolton in S2, for example). But what are they supposed to do, they are quickly headed into ""no material valley"", where there was literally nothing for them to adapt.

Then GRRM gave them the ending. Where all the pieces needed to be, when, why, and what they did. Which ones were useless. But that's not really material to adapt. That's just information, really. So when push came to shove...when they realized they were going to have to write everything from scratch from there on out...they decided to leap for that goal as fast as possible because every time they wrote from scratch it felt like the fans hated it, so they had no reason to take it slow...they were going to hate it anyway. So they rushed. Rushed as fast as they could to the finish line because they were going to get a similar reaction no matter what they did - the hardcore fans weren't going to be happy anyway.

Part of my narrative might be wrong, but I honestly think that it's way more likely than, ""D&amp;D were approached by Disney long before GoT was over and offered them a job so they rushed GoT to jump on board that instead."" I mean it could be true, but it seems unlikely. It was probably arranged after writing for S8 was mostly completed, don't forget they had been filming for over a year for S8. I think Disney just chose the worst absolute time to announce it (probably thinking S8 wouldn't go over so bad and everyone would be thrilled about the news)."

No, it happened because the existing members agreed to it. Members aren't going to agree to anything that allows a member to be removed as the act (or the threat) would massively undermine most of the protections EU members have.

&gt;That's exactly what I mean by politicians making up their own rules. I didn't say that it's all done in a cozy afternoon for them.

In which case sure, any rules can be changed if you get agreement, but that is so vague and pointless as a statement to be irrelevant to the point you responded to. EU members cannot be removed, there is no viable process that is likely to change that as it goes directly against member state interests."

Jarvan w shield doesn't really feel impactful so you only really use it for the slow which isn't that great either. 

If it counts nidalee human w and jayce melee w. Nidalee w is only used to get her passive or vision and jayce w's best part is probably the mana refund.

Iverns w is probably up there too. You need good synergy for it to be useful and the on hit damage does have high numbers but it's too situational to actually be good, even if you'd be building attack speed.

There's some that are shit but do help with champion synergy like mundo w with stacking up bonus mr or twitch with stacking his passive. But on paper both look terrible. Mundo w doesn't deal much more damage than you take if they even have a little Mr. And twitch slow isn't really all that impressive for it to be everything an ability does. (Comparable is Cassiopeia w  which has a bigger slow, aeo, grounds you and actually deals damage.)

I'm probably missing some and it seems like I can only come up with w abilities lol. But these are the abilities I could think of that feel really not that impactful when playing the champions."

*****
&gt; Protesters in Hong Kong have pledged to stand up to thugs who attacked demonstrators at the weekend as public anger grows towards the government and police.

&gt; The protests, principally over a controversial bill that would allow suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, have taken on new demands, including an investigation into police use of rubber bullets, teargas, and physical violence against protesters.

&gt; Hong Kong&amp;#039;s leader, Carrie Lam, said the &amp;quot;Shocking violence&amp;quot; in Yuen Long would be investigated, but devoted most of her comments to criticising protesters, who surrounded Beijing&amp;#039;s liaison office in Hong Kong and defaced the national emblem of the People&amp;#039;s Republic of China on Sunday.

I play the game for several hours around three times a week so I'm capped to the daily activity i can do in this time. 

This also means sacrificing this time which can be spelt else where in the tame. The parts that I find enjoyable such as dungeons PvP etc. 

I love the new zones and the lore around them they are great, but in my opinion dailies currently feel like a necessity because having access to flying dramatically changes the game for the better. Dailies offer a constant source of content which is brilliant, but shouldn't ever feel like a necessity to complete. 

Nobody is saying achieving flying is hard, but does present the dilemma of ""should I use my gaming time to do tasks that I find boring to unlock something that I want?"" 

Then magnify this by a bazillion for those people that didn't play through legion and want access to allied races. Unlocking something is great, but only if the journey there is enjoyable.

After Jesus came to Earth, you can see God is gone(physically) from the world, but left Jesus as a sacrifice and the Holy Spirit for everyone to witness.

16439,"I could be wrong, but I suspect that adding in that kind of check *to every aggro situation* would actually add significant overhead. Placing it on a request-only basis would mean that they can leave the system as is, and avoid the baggage unless it's needed. 

As for whether they *can* do it or not? I suspect they can. They can already determine how far you are from an enemy or object fairly easily. It would be almost arbitrary to define an upper limit, where the mob is forcibly reset after the fact. 

The problem, at best, appears to lie in the fact that enemies do *not* reset. If an enemy is in combat with another enemy, and you end up on the aggro table, you stay there no matter what until it dies. A simple check for range would allow you to drop off the table outside of render distance. Further, this isn't likely to cause problems in raids or dungeons because the ability to get out of range like that isn't easily achieved in a dungeon (and even then dungeons have historically utilized different ""ranges"" before reset anyway, indicating that it's more than doable). 

*TLDR*

They can absolutely check for range, they *can* determine whether or not something has a path to something (even if it's not a very good calculation), and they admittedly might not be able to check for stuck in terrain."

16457,"In my experience, there are very few adult vapers that believe vaping is harmless. Personally, I never wanted to quit smoking until I discovered vaping. I planned on continuing my pack a day habit until I died an early death, because I just didn't care. 

I still don't care about dying. I probably should, but I don't. I'm okay with dying a decade or two earlier if it means I get to consume nicotine after a long shitty day. 

When my friend started vaping, I hated it at first. Eventually he convinced me to try it, and a few months ago I finally switched completely.

I can breathe better, focus better, walk longer distances, I can spend hours at the gym when 30 minutes on a treadmill used to leave me panting like a dog. I smell like kiwi instead of tobacco, I spend less than $10 a week on vaping as opposed to $80 a week on cigs. I can make it through work without craving a smoke now, because I'm only consuming nicotine. Cigarettes contain ammonia, used to increase the intake of nicotine and make it more addictive. This is blatantly announced on any major tobacco companies website, by the way.

Despite what the media portrays, there are actually very few vapers who think it's completely safe. Many of us never envisioned a life without cigarettes, but vaping has given us control over our vices. We can choose exactly how much nicotine to use, and a majority of vapers lower their nicotine strength over time, sometimes even tapering off to 0mg and quitting altogether.

I'm not sure if I'll ever quit, as I really enjoy it, as cringy as that sounds. But I began smoking when I was in middle school simply because my mom smoked, and I was at a pack a day by the time I was 13. Sometimes I feel like I had no choice in the matter. I was a stupid kid and my mom was my idol, why wouldn't I want to be like her? But now, for the first time in over a decade, I feel free. I can easily go 12+ hours without my vape, when two hours without a cigarette was literal hell for me. 

Sorry for going off on a rant... I'm just very passionate about giving adults the option to consume legal drugs the way they choose. Nicotine is very similar to caffeine when you aren't adding a hundred other chemicals, yet many smokers still believe that the only thing they're hooked on is nicotine. When I finally quit, I went through withdrawal. It was awful. I was still getting plenty of nicotine, so clearly I was addicted to something else as well. Smoking is more than nicotine addiction, it's a specially designed cocktail of chemicals created to keep you hooked for life. Vaping is similar to drinking coffee or soda every day, just a little (or a lot) more obnoxious in public."

The Kingdom of Spain is now the Empire of Spain.

In the beginning, there was a war against the Ottomans together with Ethiopia, but after an unfortunate battle that we lost we saw the superior arms of the Ottomans and conceded defeat, losing prestige and the title Defender of Faith in the process.

Meanwhile, Poland might have interpreted [our letter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/590624740566237396/597761356061474846/Letter_to_Poland.jpg) wrongly and decided to go after his ally Prussia which got help from the Ottomans. Meanwhile, we saw this opportunity to go after Milan and Switzerland who previously embarrassed us and the Pope, while their protectors were embroiled in war with each other.

After a series of wars, the Papal States got its northern Italian provinces back and even more, currently eradicating the center of reformation in Piedmont. We got Lyonnais, Dauphiné and Savoy out of it.

We also set out to culturally enrich our holdings and have succesfully eradicated Sardinians, next up: Ligurians.

The Tripolitan vassal was integrated and through a deal with England, Songhai and Butua we got our Kongoese coast.

Our infrastructure project is severely behind since we are funding our allies too much, Spain must require more currency, by any means possible. Finally, The Protestants have formed a league challenging the right Catholic faith of the Holy Roman Empire and we pledged our help to the Emperor (Portugal) in case they actually start a war."

16570,"Today's walk home was unfun.

Firstly: Walked past a Sainsbury's (a supermarket chain) and witnessed a suited man and a supermarket employee engaged in a full on fistfight, wrestling each other to the ground, etc. Several other employees were trying to break them up and there was a big crowd staring, so I didn't get involved, but I was pretty surprised - what on earth possesses people to do this?

16573,"Depends. Just cause you can dodge one Darius Q doesn’t mean he’s still not gonna kill you. 

He’s super annoying in Lane cause he is stronger than most champs early and easily snowballs. 

You can’t give him leeway so if your champs just not as strong as him then you concede Lane which is frustrating for a lot of people. Even if they both come out of Lane with no kills and deaths the non-Darius player likely sacrificed CS just to make sure that the Darius didn’t snowball(ideal scenario). While effective for a TEAM game, as a player on a personal level not being able to participate probably isn’t very fun

I’m assuming I don’t play top Lane though and don’t personally have issues with Darius

Riven on the other hand lol"

16623,"Well, yes, but a few things. Obviously, this takes place in 1917. This means the disaster of the Somme was in recent memory for both the army and the public back in Britain. Pressure was starting to mount after 3 long years of war and horrendous losses. The army was beginning to run out of men to keep the ranks filled. Add to that that the British forces had several major offensives planned during this year. Lastly, though 1600 men lost was not a large amount in the grand scope of things, no officer would want to be responsible for the annihilation of an entire battalion. They weren't (at least most of them) *that* reckless with the lives of their soldiers. If they were going to lose that many men, there needed at least to be a *chance* of success."

16627,"&gt; All that you are saying is correct, but the idea that it is Germanys fault that Austria-Hungary went to far is weird

Without the backup from Germany it is unlikely that AH would have gone balls to the walls. They asked for German support specifically before issuing the ultimatum. Germany should have just said no. 

&gt; Also, the idea that Germany should have created an alliance that would have allowed AH to invade Serbia is really weird, too.

It's not about allowing AH to go to war, it's about Wilhelm II alianating Germany from every other European power that wasn't german-speaking. Germany as it was created in 1871 was an absolutely insane shake-up to the power balance in Europe. Germany was at that point suddenly the most militarily powerful country in continental Europe, maybe the entire world. Noone outside of Germany really liked this. As such maintaining alliances was instrumental in securing Germany's new position. Bismarck created an intricate web of alliances. Wilhelm II neglected all alliances but the Austrian alliance. This made Germany very vulnerable because if they neglected the austro-hungarian alliance they had an entire continent in discontent with them and no real allies. The UK would always have been the optimal ally for Germany for tons of reasons and I doubt the UK would have allowed AH to go to war like that.

&gt; The two big things imo. was that Germany launched a pre-emptive strike against France and invaded neutral Belgium. Especially the second part is unforgivable.

Germany declared after the mobilization of France, I think it's only a formality, it wasn't like french troops would merely stand around at the border while their ally was getting smashed. The 1870/71 war for example was declared by France but provoked by Bismarck. 

As for invading Belgium (and Luxembourg) it was a major hostile act and not doing it could have kept the UK out of the war and avoided the huge escalation. Though I'm not entirely sure the UK would have really stayed entirely out of it. Afterall this would have been a war France and Russia would have likely lost, making Germany even more powerfull."

16650,"Did I actually say anything of the sort? The actual point, which you might have understood were you not so flippant and prone to 1 liners, is that a show isn't automatically good or bad for having characters that lean this or that way on hot button issues. And since TWIA is so consistent in what they praise and crap on based on that yardstick, it calls their reliability into question whenever they spotlight those shows.

For example, this sub was all over bunny girl Senpai for its clever writing and character interactions. Meanwhile TWIA was all too happy to focus on the few times Sakuta said something that could be constructed as objectifying women (completely overlooking that that's just how he and Mai talk to eachother). Someone who just read their review would come out assuming that Bunny Girl Senpai is best avoided, while the larger Internet largely hailed it as one of the best of the year.

Now, would you like to actually refute, or are ad hominem attacks more comfortable ground?"

16655,"Albany NY?  Of course it should, but the city doesn't want ECHL, and they had trouble getting ""acceptable"" AHL attendance.  Treat it with the marketing blitz the Empire gets, with block parties and all that, and capitalize on the new apartment complexes going into the warehouse district.  Business people with money and a lack of downtown entertainment options (besides bars) are a good step.

Pair it with a franchise that people in the area are or could be attached to (Sabres and Rangers are popular in the area, Islanders have a history) and it'd be great.  And work on a rivalry with the Utica Comets.  They were too young when the Devils were going away... now that they've got a solid base of support in Utica (chronic sellouts), they'd be the perfect team for fans of either team to travel the 1.5 hours to support."

I don't think this was intentional, I don't think the work is anti-Semitic, I don't think the creators are anti-Semitic, and I don't think this ruins the show. What I do think is we should say ""Come chaps, you're better than this"" and be open to sociopolitical critiques, this sub (and many parts of the internet) seem to have a huge fear of sociopolitical critiques and prefer to name call rather than actually engage rather than debate. Having said that I am quite pleased that, for the most part, the responses to this post have been reasonable and open to dialogue."

16763,"Yeah, I think the criticism is mostly because we've normalized a lot of the impressive shit MCU movies do, and a bit of overreaction because the movie was perceived to be overrated for social reasons and reddit loves to be contrarian.

16797,I really don't think that the fact that NA fans use twitter a lot has anything to do with player's motivation.

16853,Nah. He’d be way more shaky if it were. Aim like this just takes lots of practice on console.
16854,"I agree he doesn't usually put in a defensive effort and can be a liability for sure, but he's not more error prone than Xhaka who starts every game and has the armband because he shouts and apparently is good at handing out fines in the locker room. I'm just saying that while Ozil is certainly not the Ozil he was a few years ago, to refuse to ever play him because he's a liability while always playing Xhaka seems hypocritical, especially when Arsenal currently looks like they could do with someone behind those front three with Ozil's offensive abilities. He doesn't deserve to start every game right now, but he deserves at least having a go, imo. You could put Guendouzi and Torreira behind him and with clear instructions for Torreira to sit and Guendouzi to be a disciplined box to box I think that could be potentially more defensively solid than having Xhaka as the anchor.

FWIW I think their ""typical"" starting midfield should be Guendouzi, Torreira, and one of Ceballos or Willock, but would like to see Ozil get some chances to release Pepe and Auba."

16876,"I don't agree. If you don't like the soup you point it out - because if you don't do it, the cook will continue doing it the same way, because he received the positive opinion. How can he make it better if he doesn't know what to change? That's why the cook need the negative feedback to make it better for more people, or maybe prepare other dish to balance it out. If he would continue to serve the soup that is not liked, many people will go eat elsewhere. Or maybe you would prefer the school example? Can you imagine receiving only good grades, despite failing to give correct answers on exams? If you are not being punished for not doing homework, next time you will also not do it.

Every developer will tell you, that even if getting the positive feedback is nice, it's the negative feedback that is the most important for the project.

I love the game, but i also think that it's slowly losing it's life essense. I'm playing almost from the start and i can feel that it is losing it's pace. If i wouldn't care about the game i would move on to others, but i still roam around and give my feedback (as constructive as possible).

Jack Harris is by far the best candidate in the riding (in my opinion), and he's well liked by those who have voted for him, but if the NDP are polling at only 10% that's a tough uphill battle.

I think once we get closer to the election that the NDP will surge a bit higher in NL. Harris is their best chance at capturing any seats in Atlantic Canada. I thought he was a shoe-in as well, but those dire polling numbers plus another potential strategic ABC vote looming, I'm not so sure."

16947,"&gt; The question itself might not be problematic , but the reason for asking is also important , if there is proof the reason they want the data is nefarious or illegal that is problematic

Interesting how you cite the ""legitimate proof"" they sought how to better gerrymander districts without actually citing that ""legitimate proof"" - allow me to do so for you:  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/census-citizenship-question-hofeller.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share

The study was not - as you claim - commissioned by the GOP, it was instead commissioned by a private new outlet:

&gt;The documents cited in the Thursday court filing include an **unpublished August 2015 analysis by Mr. Hofeller, who was hired by The Washington Free Beacon,** a conservative news outlet financially backed by Paul Singer, a billionaire New York hedge fund manager and major Republican donor. **Mr. Hofeller’s charge was to assess the impact of drawing political maps that were not based on a state’s total population — the current practice virtually everywhere in the nation — but on a slice of that population: American citizens of voting age.**

The conclusion was not - as you claim - that citizenship data could ""better help the GOP gerrymander"" but to assess what the impact would be of drawing districts based on *total voting population* rather than total population - as Mr. Singer - again, a private entity - was considering supporting a supreme court case seeking exactly that.

The conclusion of the study is that drawing districts in *total population* gave democrat voters an unfair advantage, as areas that traditionally voted democrat were home to more non-citizens and illegal immigrants - which results in fewer *eligible voters* per district, and more total districts won with the same number of democrat voters.

Thus, changing the system so that each eligible voter possessed a vote of the same power would make democrat districts larger (as they have to include larger areas to match the eligible voting populations in republican districts) and shrink the number of traditionally-democrat voting districts.

So yes, lets stop spreading misinformation about some non-existent plot by the GOP, and all appreciate the irony of democrats screeching about unequal vote powers when it comes to the electoral college while simultaneously benefiting from the exact same inequality when it comes to congress."

That said, the scenes of flat lands that don't include the bay could still be geographically possible if they're further inland between mountains. But, the original shots of KL, as seen in the third image from the article, make it hard for people to accept that the wide open areas existed at all. Those scenes merely require the suspension of disbelief, but the bay scenes make that hard to do given that they were original shown to include hills."

Me and a couple of friends have 4 pens between us, and all 3 of us can shrug off timing out (10 second rip) all 4 pens at once, all on their highest setting with this technique. 

Honestly, by the way, 4 dab pens at once is a really different high. All you guys should try it if you gt the chance"

17120,I think might became a nightmare for the writers. It becomes constant arguments of what’s canon and what’s not canon. Because there would likely be people that like the new timeline better and deem the current timeline obsolete/vice versa. Then the writers have to juggle two storylines that make sense. It would be a mess I feel like.

17136,"And that's the challenge I face when trying to figure out which side of the fence I sit on, because I completely agree that the child's interests should be the priority.

Should a woman whose engages in sex under false pretenses, (saying they are on the pill, but are not actually), be punished somehow?  I think so, but not at the expense of the child.  By suggesting a man removing a condom after consent, negates that consent, it shows consent is conditional.  It's got to be a two way street somehow, just not something I have a solution for... But at the end of the day, there's got to be personal responsibility from both parties... if you're a man who wants sex, but not risk pregnancy - wear a condom.  If you're a woman on the pill and don't want to risk it, make him wear a condom.  Neither gives a 100% of preventing unwanted pregnancy anyways, so why not use both for the best odds?"

I'm not sure how to find how many total games there were on each combo, though. It'd definitely be interesting to see if they just played uncommon combinations or if some of them are played more often. I know some combos will have more plays, like Sivir/Lux, but I'm sure if something like Varus/Galio would be played that much."

First, can we agree that competitions occur at different levels, for example the Olympic Games and a high school sports competition. 
Now, if you agree to this, I think my next point may already be clear. Considering most top guilds who are racing for WF clear the full raid within 2-3 lockouts, a guild that is two weeks late is literally doubling the time required.

    Please point me towards a study that showcases my obvious advantages or even sports events where transgender women (such as the olympics) have dominated.

Studies of ‘normally active’ transwomen with several years of hormone treatment flanking orchidectomy are still stronger than female reference levels

Medicine Alone Does Not Completely Suppress Testosterone Levels Among Transgender Women Only a quarter of transgender women taking a regimen of spironolactone and estrogens were able to lower testosterone levels within the usual female physiologic range. Another quarter could not achieve female levels but remained below the male range virtually all of the time, while one quarter was unable to achieve any significant suppression.

does not reverse the impact that T had during puberty. Puberty and early adulthood was when the size and shape of the male body was formed. well-documented physical advantages men have over women include, longer limbs, a larger rib cage with larger organs like heart and lungs, bigger hands, their legs are more vertical due to a narrow pelvis, height, weight, broader shoulders, greater circulating blood volume, greater resistance to dehydration, larger lung capacity, thicker skin, faster sensory frame shifting, more hemoglobin in the blood, greater upper-body strength, faster reaction times, greater bone density in the arms, larger sweat capacity, higher systolic blood pressure, higher muscle-to-fat ratio, and larger hearts the list goes on. The male body is optimised for physical performance. In contrast, in females there is an evolutionary trade-off between physical performance and the ability to bear children.

muscles built under the influence of Testosterone will be easier to build in the future even in the absence of Testosterone.. ‘Muscle memory’ means that if an elite athlete takes performance-enhancing drugs, they may continue to be at an advantage over their competitors even if they stop taking the drugs. This is why elite athletes can have their titles removed retrospectively if they are later found to have taken performance enhancing drugs at any point in the past (not just at the time the title was acquired). Therefore it male-born transgender athletes who once trained under the influence of natural testosterone will forever be at an advantage https://m*d*ium.com/@Antonia_Lee/myonuclei-the-male-to-female-sporting-advantage-ae205110d4b2 https://www.livescience.com/52998-women-combat-gender-differences.html https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jappl.2000.89.1.81 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00235103

Instead they were forced into a open stairway that went *towards* the smoke, and any that made it would have to struggle with a complicated door.

Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how “sensitive they are to criticism”.

&gt; New self-titled Pepper album drops Fall 2013!! 

&gt; Facebook www.facebook.com/pepperlive; Twitter www.twitter.com/pepperlive; Instagram www.instagram.com/pepperlive

&gt; Kaleo Wassman – Vocals/Guitar
Bret Bollinger – Vocals/Bass
Yesod Williams – Drums

&gt; “It’s the hardest thing we’ve ever done as a band to make this record,” says guitarist/vocalist Kaleo Wassman of Pepper, in speaking on the recording process of their new self-titled album. “It speaks loudly and widely to a broader audience while maintaining everything good about the band, which, first of all, is our positive attitude.” After releasing five albums, Pepper has opened a new chapter in their storied career. Drummer Yesod Williams adds, “This record feels very cohesive in a way our past releases maybe didn’t. I think it’s an album that can appeal to everyone, as well.  We’ve been pigeonholed in the past so this is an opportunity to transcend all that and spread our wings even wider.” 

&gt; The trio, who formed in 1997 and moved to the mainland from their hometown of Kailua Kona, Hawaii in 1999, pressed pause after the release of their fifth album, Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations, in 2008. There was a sense of fatigue and disunity amongst the three musicians, who took some time off from music both apart and together before rejoining to create an EP, Stiches, in late 2010. The songs on that release re-energized the group, revealing an urgent desire to make a new album that reflected where they are in their lives and career now. After some tour dates in support of the EP, Pepper sat down and focused on their sixth album, a self-titled released that swings open the door on this new chapter. 

&gt; The musicians went into the studio with Matt Wallace, a producer known for his work with Maroon 5, O.A.R. and Faith No More, in early 2012. Matt helped focus the group’s vision and expand their musical knowledge base, an experience the band members compare to being in their own version of college. The album was recorded in various studios over the course of a year, honing in on Pepper’s re-defined self-identity and how that focus was reflected in the songs. 

&gt; “We learned so much,” Yesod says. “Matt help us really focus on the art of songwriting. He sat in the room with the three of us with a fine-tooth comb and went over every word, every melody, every sound. He showed us that it’s important what you do play as well as what you don’t play, creating both spaces in the songs. We learned how powerful simplicity can be. Plus, we had such a good time recording this album and I think that shows.”

&gt; The resulting album, self-titled to accentuate where the band feels they are presently, broadens Pepper’s style, veering into new sonic territory while still retaining all the fun elements that make the band so beloved by their fans. The ever-present sense of life surges through the tracks, bolstering the sense of optimism throughout. The party anthems, the beach hang melodies, and the boisterous rhythms are all there, each song carefully crafted to best express these sunny moments by the ocean. 

&gt; “This album is basically 12 snapshots of where we are,” vocalist/bassist Bret Bollinger says. “There are songs that will remind you of your favorite Pepper songs, but by the end you’ll hear some unexpected things. You’ll realize that the songwriting is so much more refined. And there’s laughter in the background of the songs. That’s how good the vibe is on the record.” 

&gt; Pepper has toured extensively with groups like 311, Slightly Stoopid, Flogging Molly and Sublime With Rome, and spent several summers on Warped Tour – and this live sensibility shows. You can almost feel the sand in your toes and the sun on your back as the album progresses, the musician’s amiable personalities palpable beneath the island rhythms and mellow tones. The band’s music – both live and on their releases – is really about enjoying life and being grateful for each experience, a sensibility that’s very familiar to the three musicians currently in their career. From their 1999 debut Give’n It to their 2006 standout album No Shame, which was recorded with 311’s Nick Hexum, No Doubt’s Tony Kanal and Butthole Surfers’ Paul Leary, Pepper has embodied not only a style of music but a lifestyle, one that’s most easily found on beaches across the world, but also one that’s relatable to anyone anywhere. 

&gt; Released via their own label LAW Records, their universal appeal has led their music being placed in various movies and TV shows, including Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Good Luck Chuck, as well as several video game soundtracks. The band’s story to date has been a prolific one. But as Pepper turns the page into a fresh chapter with this new album, it’s clear that the band’s passion for music and life will continue on for years to come. 

&gt; “We’re so blessed to be in this position,” Kaleo says. “We want to do the best we can with it. We had humble beginnings in our small town in Hawaii and we’re still that same humble band. We don’t take any of this lightly. Every day I wake up and think about how I have the best job in the world. The level of gratitude and happiness I have that we’re able to do this is incredible and I hope people can hear that when they listen to our new songs.”  Read more on Last.fm.

Some context before the story, the ex principal of my school is a massive bitch that never shows up to work and is always trying to get off work when she's actually here.

We have a kid that needed special attention, I have no idea what his condition is but unless there's an adult constantly close to him calming him down, he gets super panicky because of the high number of people sharing the classroom with him and shuts down. The school asked the city administration to hire a psicologist/nurse person that would accompany him during his classes and help him around by sitting next to him and helping.

The principal said that the city administration refused to hire someone but less than a month later there was a new secretary working in the principal's office. She was doing literally all of the principal's work while the actual principal was missing work.

Almost one year later of this we had a surprise inspection. The house of cards fell, the principal wasant at work and the secretary under heavy pressure spilled the beans.

The principal did in fact hired a special psicologist nurse thing to accompany my student. But she decided to make a deal with her, the principal would give her about 5% of her pay if the nurse would do her work for her instead of being the nurse we needed. While they forged the school records to show that they both were doing their jobs.

The principal got fired, the nurse managed to prove in court that she was being ""pressured by her superior"" to do it, so she wasn't fired and now she is finally doing what her job demands.

- go 10/0 in lane but have win trading solo laner = get blown up and your advantage cannot over come a single full combo from a win trade 5/0 enemy champ which is no fun

I think adc is such a precarious role where no matter how fed you get, you cannot win against win traders and at the point the game is literally out of your hands. You dont have control and it feels like a sunken cost fallacy; you get a lot less than what you put in.

17569,"I’m not sure how you got that opinion although I do respect it. You’re only in the beginning of season 7, so I’ll discount that season, but all of this she earned on her own: 

Her smaller Khalasar in the beginning. They were going to take her to Vaes Dothrak prior to the dragons hatching. 

Hatching her dragons. The eggs were given to her, but she figured out how to hatch them herself. 

The unsullied.

Astapor/Yunkai/Mereen. True, she didn’t swing a sword, but she’s not that type of warrior. She was the one who came up with the battle plans to conquer each slave city. 

The remaining Dothraki. She killed the Khals and the remaking Dothraki decided to follow her because of her strength. She proved herself strong in that moment. 

Defeating the slavers. This is where we see the type of warrior Dany is. Yes, she’s on the back of a dragon, but she earned that herself. Many people have died either attempting to hatch dragons or ride them. Becoming a dragon rider isn’t easy, at least if we are going off the lore of the books. 

But I respect your opinion obviously. I just don’t like the idea that “Dany was handed everything and didn’t earn it.” It’s fine if you don’t prefer her stance of being a warrior, it isn’t for everyone since it does look much easier when you have dragons. But she lost her husband and son to hatch them. She has earned her power up to the point of where you are."

Amazon.com Inc has a promotion for U.S. shoppers on Prime Day, the 48-hour marketing blitz that started Monday: Earn $10 of credit if you let Amazon track the websites you visit.

The deal is for new installations of the Amazon Assistant, a comparison-shopping tool that customers can add to their web browsers. It fetches Amazon's price for products that users see on Walmart.com, Target.com and elsewhere.

In order to work, the assistant needs access to users' web activity, including the links and some page content they view. The catch, as Amazon explains in the fine print, is the company can use this data to improve its general marketing, products and services, unrelated to the shopping assistant."

I’d agree with some others who felt like the third act fell a little flat. There was so much build up to Roy teaching his father and then it just sort of came and went uneventfully. When his father wanted to be cut loose to die, I didn’t feel any sort of emotion or connection to make it impactful. I liked the ending idea around there being no intelligent life, I understood the message, but I feel like it could’ve been expanding on more (for example is that what drove his father mad?)."

17677,"One of the circle jerkers! No animosity here, just thought i’d take the time to answer your question.

The difference between “I don’t want it” and Varys’s “for the realm” is that Varys still had plenty of thoughtful, intense, and nuanced scenes with plenty of characters. (IE his talks with Little Finger, Tyrion, etc. circa seasons 1-6).  It was more of a mantra that had purpose and further moved along his character arc. Jon used to be a character who fought for things, was King like, and too had more lines than just “I don’t want it”. For such a powerful, important character to be dwindled down to 3 lines is a disservice."

If housing prices came down, younger Canadians would be able to afford homes, and would be happy with the politicians.  Boomers ""might"" get pissed off and not be happy with em.  I don't think that's an entirely unrealistic take on the situation.

Heck, I know a boomer that literally had to watch his daughter, and his grandkids, move to another province in order to have a home.  He bought his place like a century ago (heh, give or take ;p) for like 80k or somethin, and its worth, well, a lot more as of the last assessment.  He's not gonna leave that place till he dies, or HAS to go to an old person's home - its not like there's a mortgage payment, and the city taxes are pretty easy to cover.  And he's one of the many boomers that bought their ""forever home"" in their late 20s early 30s -- mortgages paid by ~50-55 -- so like 10-15 years where they were earning peak income, while also not having to pay anything on the mortgage/loans: it was just huge savings increases.

17770,"&gt;There are a bunch that are trying to do the same thing, but none that have done it as well as RATM by combining political lyrics with staggering musical gifts.

All of the bands I listed off do exactly that. RATM didn't get popular solely on their lyrics and ""staggering"" music. A lot of American audiences didn't even take RATM too seriously, in terms of their lyrics (see: Paul Ryan.) What made RATM hit in particular was the aggression in their music that was the trend of rap/rock and nu-metal acts coming up at the same time they were. They had a marketable sound. Which is fine. I'm a communist and I don't really down on RATM for taking the major label route. Morello is ultimately right; it's an effective way of getting the message out to a wider audience, even if most of them don't take it seriously. But RATM is not the only ones who were, by any stretch of the imagination.

But there were and are plenty of bands with huge talent and potent lyrics out there, but they are not mass-marketable sounds.

&gt;I've been looking, including some of those you mentioned, but none have been able to touch Rage in the 90s

I mean, this is straggling the line between ""okay, personal preference I guess"" and ""complete bullshit."" You can't tell me that the Coup didn't have better rhymes than Zack, because there are a lot of songs from them that I would count as better than Zack at his best and most poetic.

Cue me looking for my glasses for 30 minutes before giving up and leaving for the funeral we were late for.  Come home and find them in a drawer that is never opened.

Second, I lost my debit card and found it INSIDE my car's console.  Like I had to take my car apart to find it.  Then it happened to my phone too.  How does something just end up inside a car.

Third, I was driving my husband from the eye doctor and outside just looked different.  It was like the trees and grass was wrong.  I haven't been able to shake the feeling that everything is wrong.

Also linking the video in your original post would've clued me and the rest of the world in on your version of groping and this comment chain would've never existed. But I guess its good so people can see that this was all BS."
17830,Right. I am just wondering the situation whereby people simply don’t answer the door or come out. What then? Will the police need a warrant?

17854,"Lol, ADC isn't number 1 impact.

The list should be Jungle/Mid/Support/Top/ADC. A bad ADC can really bring your team down, but a good ADC is pretty useless if your support sucks. And through proper map management, mid/jungle have the biggest influence on the outcome of the game as they can either easily stop an enemy from getting to far ahead or help a teammate get far ahead. Or control all the objectives."

17859,"I agree with you almost completely, and think they REALLY need to loosen up their restrictions.

However, I can also understand that there are some combinations that just flat-out wouldn't make sense.  Demon Hunters is an easy one.  Given the history and origins of the class, it just wouldn't make sense to have, say, a Gnome Demon Hunter.  Being a Demon Hunter isn't something you ""learn"" so it couldn't be explained away like Monks who can just teach anybody their ways.  And their origins are tied to a particular moment in the history of the world so it'd be tough to retcon it out without seeming really, really contrived (""oh yeah, even though they never showed up on-screen in any way it turns out Illidan actually DID convert other races besides elves, you just never saw them or heard about anything they ever did until now"").

I think a lot of things could be loosened up without much issue.  But there are some things that are just a little too set in stone to make sense."
17860,"I think it's unlikely too. But, they've done similar stuff before: for example, [Horizon Lunar Colony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91nfDfnGCB0) was teased and then revealed on May 31st, and the [Anniversary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXVwK2x422Q) event began May 23rd. 

So, why'd you ask me if I watched the dev update? What did I miss?"
17861,"See, I think the production is supposed to sound very similar. I see this album as more of just a very long song more than your regular album. There’s not really any specific song I’d listen to on it’s own, and if you took any song out, the project wouldn’t be the same. That’s how I feel at least. I’m not a die hard Tyler fan, either, as Flower Boy was the only album I fully finished, though I did love it. To each their own though."

And we don’t know if at that point Portland will be. No disrespect to them, I just mean, things change."
17865,"Just took a listen, it sounds more like POD or linkin park mixed with AFI.

17870,"You're spot on, we have great first aid, but not health care. By the time you go to the ER for something that ends up being cancer because your GP has not taken the build up to that point seriously, it's too late. Our primary care system is complete garbage and we have such an inferiority complex versus the US ingrained in us that US BAD is the only thing people can muster when you pit primary care of CAN against US. 

Our healthcare is not free, you just don't see the cost because it's rolled into that huge general portion of taxes taken off each pay cheque, charged with every purchase, added to every utility, etc. If people had 50%+ more money in their pockets and had to spend 40% of it on healthcare they would be aghast, but that's what we're doing right now. Then you roll into it on top of that, spending even more after tax money on private diagnostic screenings because the primary care system is in such shambles, it's even worse."

8\~9 are good shows that would recommend to people and they are good in all aspects.

You meet fascinating people, often powerful people, and on a few occasions you can just have a chat with them and then go about your day. You run into authors you like or overhear business proposals or market information. You are surrounded by culture. 

People don't spend their money on small urban apartments just for shits and giggles. They spend that money to be close to important events and ideas.

There was a single line about how the moon pirates, who are sponsored by rival governments, take VIP hostages for ransom. 



I could live with all of those minor inconsistencies, but the main one that stood out is the instigating incident. Space is astronomically huge, and Earth and Neptune are on different orbits. SpaceCom thought TLJ was actively targeting Earth because of that. It turns out it's just a coincidence due to malfunctioning, sabotaged equipment? Even with suspension of disbelief, you could just point the satellite dish in the other direction without blowing up the entire place! It felt like there was some other ending in the original draft."

Also, even if he \*could\* argue executive privilege, all that means is the house would need to present evidence to the court that the material is essential to the justice of the case. If the investigation is into Trump himself and his communications with foreign leaders then it's very likely the courts would agree that was the case

Also, it's very unlikely the courts would take a case on impeachment. It's neither a criminal nor civil charge, and is ruled on by the senate rather than a judge. In fact the constitution states that the senate has the sole power to judge on impeachment, which would seem to make it unconstitutional for a criminal court to rule on it. I'm be curious what case law you're referencing which leads you to think that the supreme court would have any authority beyond that of the senate in this situation"

17949,"The fact that there are players who keep multiple accounts in the Top 500 ranking - despite requiring SMS verification to do so - shows that a 2FA requirement wouldn't do much to stem the tide of smurfs. 

The only way something like this could feasibly work is if every person in the world had a unique personal identifier that could only be linked to a single account - but that comes with a ton of data protection risks attached. (As an example, many online services in South Korea used to require a person use their Resident Registration Number to sign up for accounts, but a major hack on SK's most popular IM infrastructure exposed something like 70% of the nation's RRNs, which ended the practice for services that don't explicitly require the RRN for payment verification.)

&amp;nbsp;

As it's impractical to eliminate the *creation* of smurf accounts, the only feasible solutions involve making it harder - either in terms of time or money - to access Competitive mode. In practice, that would involve either raising the level requirement for Competitive, or reducing the price of the game further but also requiring that players purchase some kind of pass to unlock Competitive mode which is locked to a single account (which would address smurfing on console, but not so much on PC where the cost of entry is already lower).

Even then, though, that doesn't stop people creatng surfs to stomp over people in non-Competitive modes, which is apparently where a large proportion of the player base spend their time."

Unless we want to play it at, say, 10 bpm. Which we don't.

&gt;  
&gt;Robert Rowland, an MEP for South East England, said EU vessels  that entered the exclusion zone would be ""given the same treatment as  the Belgrano"" - an Argentinian warship that was torpedoed by a British  submarine during the Falklands War with the loss of 323 lives.

Isaac pointed out that he'd been involved with GoT for half his life - and fan pressure made him stop his degree because they were following him around so much that he had to have security.

The lad who played Olly got death threats and local kids even threatened to damage his scooter - he was just 16.

For the older ones, they were just grateful to have a job. John and Kit were just finishing their degrees and John had never done film. Emilia was working in a cafe, Richard Madden was also between jobs and expected to be going back to living with his parents."

18010,"&gt;Around that time, there was quite a lot of movement among keepers in Italy, with Buffon signing for Juve, Francesco Toldo going to Inter Milan and Sebastien Frey moving to Parma. It was a kind of jostle between goalies at the top clubs, but I was left out. I then spoke to Ajax, to Liverpool and to Dortmund. The latter two wanted to wait until the end of the summer transfer window. I didn't want to be hanging on for that long. Fulham had some big ambitions – they had just won the First Division title to go into the Premier League and were signing a lot of new players. I just wanted to play some football. I consulted Louis van Gaal, who was the Netherlands’ national coach at the time, and he was really positive about the move. I saw it as maybe taking one small step back in order to then try to make several steps forward further down the line.

4. Water-walking mounts

As of the most recent patch, water-walking can be given to any mount now.

WoW *used to* differentiate between mount qualities that gave different run speed increases, but that system was phased out a long time ago. Now, any mount can be used at any level once riding skill has been learned with the level of riding skill being the only determining factor in mount speed. That is, you can always ride any mount so long as you can ride mounts and their speed upgrades with riding skill.

There are still mounts that can't fly and not every mount can carry passengers, which are the only functional differences. Otherwise, mount selection is 100% cosmetic."

18120,"Thanks for the segue b/c I was just about to get to this.... once you get to Khashoggi you are suddenly in Iran Contra/BCCI world.  BCCI being the biggest scandal in US history in my opinion.  Obvious Bush/Iran Contra connection

&gt; Khashoggi was implicated in the Iran–Contra affair as a key middleman in the arms-for-hostages exchange along with Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and, in a complex series of events, was found to have borrowed money for these arms purchases from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) with Saudi and United States backing.[2] His role in the affair created a related controversy when Khashoggi donated millions to the American University in Washington, DC to build a sports arena which would bear his name.[16] Khashoggi was a member of the university's board of trustees from 1983 until his indictment on fraud and other charges in May 1989.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Khashoggi

Now tell me these are loose connections when you consider Adnan Khashoggi’s brother in law Mohamed Fayed was fucking George de Mohrenschildt’s daughter.  

George de Mohrenschildt was the Uncle to George HW Bush’s roommate @ his private school Andover.  

&gt; The CIA staff assumed the letter writer to be a crank. Just to be sure, however, they asked their boss: Did he by any chance know a man named de Mohrenschildt?Bush responded by memo, seemingly self-typed:  I do know this man DeMohrenschildt. I first men [sic] him in the early 40’3 [sic]. He was an uncle to my Andover roommate. 

- https://whowhatwhy.org/2013/10/14/bush-and-the-jfk-hit-part-5-the-mysterious-mr-de-mohrenschildt/

From the section on the Wiki letter to cia Director which was George HW Bush:

&gt; On September 17, 1976, the CIA requested that the FBI locate Mohrenschildt, because he had ""attempted to get in touch with the CIA Director.""[55] On September 5, 1976, Mohrenschildt had written a letter to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, George H. W. Bush, asking for his assistance. He was acquainted with the Bush family; George H.W. Bush had roomed with Mohrenschildt's nephew, Edward G. Hooker, at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.[56] The letter said:

You will excuse this hand-written letter. Maybe you will be able to bring a solution to the hopeless situation I find myself in. My wife and I find ourselves surrounded by some vigilantes; our phone bugged; and we are being followed everywhere. Either FBI is involved in this or they do not want to accept my complaints. We are driven to insanity by the situation. I have been behaving like a damn fool ever since my daughter Nadya died from [cystic fibrosis] over three years ago. I tried to write, stupidly and unsuccessfully, about Lee H Oswald and must have angered a lot of people — I do not know. But to punish an elderly man like myself and my highly nervous and sick wife is really too much. Could you do something to remove the net around us? This will be my last request for help and I will not annoy you any more. Good luck in your important job. Thank you so much.[57][58]

&gt; George H. W. Bush responded:

&gt; Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic death a few years ago, and the current poor state of your wife's health. I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. In your situation I can well imagine how the attentions you described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. The flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren Commission has long subsided. I can only speculate that you may have become ""newsworthy"" again in view of the renewed interest in the Kennedy assassination, and thus may be attracting the attention of people in the media. I hope this letter had been of some comfort to you, George, although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.

2. ""Gradually shifting towards a conformity with FFP"" is a horrible sign - as FFP is quite forgiving.

When did I ever say this? I am not arguing for this, and have never done so. In simple terms what I'm saying is this:

- They make a separate group that can turn into man eating monster and have special powers.
- They link that group with Jewish imagery.
- Oh no, the stuff you did in point 1 coincides with traditional anti-Semitic rhetoric and propaganda. This is accidentally endorses some things you maybe didn't want to.

18230,"This has been discussed quite a lot over the past couple of months.     
      
The Prime Minister is appointed by the monarch to form a government.  The person appointed is one who can command a majority in the House of Commons, because a PM with no majority wouldn’t be able to pass a budget or a programme of legislation, so wouldn’t be able to run a working government.   
    
Under the (relatively recent) Fixed Term Parliament Act, if the opposition pass a Vote Of No Confidence in the current government, Parliament has a period of 14 days to pass a vote of confidence in either the current government or an alternative government.  If no vote of confidence is passed within the 14 day period, the PM calls a General Election to be held at a time of his choice (I don’t think there’s a specific time by which the election has to be held, but I hope someone might confirm that).    
      
Despite Boris no longer having a majority, no VoNC has been passed yet because everyone thinks he won’t call an election until after the UK has left the EU with no deal.    
      
The idea of an “Interim PM” has been discussed as being someone who will be supported by a majority of the House only to arrange an extension to Brexit and then to call a General Election.  He or she won’t have support to pass a budget or a programme of legislation,  but will have support to delay the UK’s exit from the EU and to call an election.
     
The obvious choice of PM after a VoNC in Boris is Jeremy Corbyn, but the position seems to be that there are enough MPs who don’t want No Deal but also won’t support Corbyn, so neither Boris nor his main opponent are likely to be able to command a majority, so it has been suggested that another senior MP could become “Interim PM”.

18327,"Overanyzing:

Well, its true all 3 girls and kazuma are part of the main cast, are they the main characters? Kazuma is in nearly every scene (In fact, I think every scene) so he is most definitely the protagonist. All 3 girls show up every single episode except darkness for a couple of episodes in the 20 total episodes. Each get alot of screentime, of course with main cast and with kazuma individually (Sometimes character may get an arc that triggers this). So I bring up the question again, is Aqua a main character? Obviously, if megumin and darkness are main characters, so is aqua, vice-versa. Showing up every single episode with own arcs and plenty of individual scenes with the protagonist kazuma, I can say most definitely she is a main character. If she was not a main character, that would mean other shows like monogatari or gotoubun, all the characters outside protagonist would be side characters, which is simply false. Noticible side characters in Konosuba include: Wiz, Yun-Yun.

Tldr: Aqua is a main character, you are correct."

And anyway, it wouldn't even make sense in the context of the Craig films. Both Skyfall and Spectre were very personal stories about Bond's past demons. His past life isn't something fabricated for a cover identity. The old man at Skyfall even recognises Bond from when he was a boy, and we see clearly the name of Bond's parents in the Chapel Graveyard.

A few decades ago there were lots more believers than there are now, thats because more generations received the education and the strong believes in race theory have mostly died out. Thats because over 70 years after WW2, most people have died and others have gained the education to understand the problems.  

Even the Magyar can change, its just not gonna be something that happens quickly, it might takes hundreds of years even but as long as education keeps telling them the scientific facts it will ignite change.  
If a goverment takes a strong stance on issues it will slowly convert people to take the same stance as long as the stance is logical and proven.

18469,"&gt; Did you read the Mueller Report? It laid out how the GRU hacked the DNC.  
  
Wait, you do know that it was Crowdstrike that supposedly did the investigation into the Russian hacking? And that they were hired by the DNC and denied the FBI &amp; DOJ access? And provided a redacted report? The FBI,DOJ and Mueller have not seen the actual ""evidence"" and are going based on the Crowdstrike redacted report.    
    
[Mueller’s Own Report Undercuts Its Core Russia-Meddling Claim](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2019/07/05/crowdstrikeout_muellers_own_report_undercuts_its_core_russia-meddling_claims.html)  
  
&gt; The report uses qualified and vague language to describe key events, indicating that Mueller and his investigators do not actually know for certain whether Russian intelligence officers stole Democratic Party emails, or how those emails were transferred to WikiLeaks.  
  
&gt; The report's timeline of events appears to defy logic. According to its narrative, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced the publication of Democratic Party emails not only before he received the documents but before he even communicated with the source that provided them.  
  
&gt; Mueller’s decision not to interview Assange – a central figure who claims Russia was not behind the hack – suggests an unwillingness to explore avenues of evidence on fundamental questions.  
  
&gt; **U.S. intelligence officials cannot make definitive conclusions about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer servers because they did not analyze those servers themselves. Instead, they relied on the forensics of CrowdStrike, a private contractor for the DNC that was not a neutral party, much as “Russian dossier” compiler Christopher Steele, also a DNC contractor, was not a neutral party. This puts two Democrat-hired contractors squarely behind underlying allegations in the affair – a key circumstance that Mueller ignores.**  
  
A judge just ruled that Mueller broke a rule and does not even have sufficient evidence to prove that the Russian government was connected to the hacking.

18480,"&gt;Fro her release discussion/interview:  
 **How would you classify Dianas gameplay style?**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Volty:** I consider her a fighter or assassin. What I mean by that is that other comparable assassins in the game, characters that can dive in quickly on a vulnerable target, generally have ways to avoid taking damage or get out of that sticky situation and Diana doesnt have any of those things, but instead has durability. Her base durability is a little bit higher than you would expect for an assassin and Pale Cascade adds a lot of durability, specifically durability that comes with building Ability Power to begin with. We tested a lot of builds with Diana. Is it a full AP build or more tanky with more inherited ability from items? We believe the most potent build is the full AP build, which Im happy about because that reinforces Pale Cascade.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Davin:** I am really happy about that ability because its much more of a risk/reward skill. If youre ok at it, youre going to absorb some damage and have a good time. If youre great at it, youre going to absorb a lot of damage while dealing damage.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Volty:** It rewards aggression, too. You get more shield for using up the orbs. They detonate; you refresh the shield.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Davin:** You cant just roll your face and do it. If you plan well, its going to be better.  

That release year schedule (2011-2012) saw Riot experimenting with these kind of Hybrid champions that were in one role but kind of had elements of another role in them. Vayne was a Ranged ADC/Assassin, Graves was a Ranged ADC/Bruiser, and Diana was an Assassin/Bruiser. All three had a lot of nerfs and changes to get rid of that kind of dual identity, for the most part, but Diana is harder for them to balance, because when she's actually hard to kill she is to strong, and when she's not hard to kill she's just kind of a less good assassin.  


And from the patch notes:  
 

&gt;[**v7.14**](https://lol.gamepedia.com/V7.14#Diana)  
*Passive’s attack speed now procs off spellcasts and increases with E rank. Passive attack now restores mana. Q cooldown reduced at early levels. W mana cost reduced at early levels.*   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Diana’s a champion with fractured identities, sitting somewhere in the middle of assassin and diver, laner and jungler. While this multifaceted nature works for some champions, we’ve seen what happens when an assassin gets to be tanky, or when a diver gets to blow people up. This makes Diana difficult to tune on a patch-by-patch basis, since we can’t responsibly balance Diana around a single identity without first giving her the tools to succeed in that role. (Read: she needs an update.)"

18673,"It is. The [IMBD summary confirms it](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327842/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl).

&gt;This genre-bending anthology takes place during a series of world-wide blackouts, after which millions of mysterious cosmic anomalies appear everywhere across the planet. While many flee from the objects, the real terror sets in as people are drawn toward - and into - them.

It doesn't, just shit policies and moronic ideologies. He said for the progressive congresswomen go back to the countries they ancestrally hail from, and use your policies to see if it fixes them. Had nothing to do with race, but ideology. That's the brilliance of the tweet ;)

&gt;Trumps not so subtle racism is a huge draw to a whole lot of Trump supporters to begin with.

They put cages around were the women sections. Tickets were sold via internet and it was all sold out immediately and made many women and fans wondering if it was another show just like Persepolis final match in Tehran which Fraud Infantino attended. They were use this as a purple movement to advertise for so called moderators, CNN, ESPN, Guardian used this to also advertise for them.

To be fair...

I was shocked they gave one to Obama.

I was like.. *dude, Alfred Nobel wanted this to go to science discoveries that help mankind.*

Like the fucking polio vaccine.

He would shit 10 gold bricks and press them into a gold plated prize himself if he were here for Obama's award.

Also, Alfred Nobel *never* had economics as a category.

It was the bank of Switzerland that tried to pull that off, and since they can't claim a Nobel prize...

They have this bullshit *Memorial Nobel prize in memory of Alfred Nobel.*

[They are imposters, and always have been.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences?wprov=sfla1)

Also, neoliberal economics is not a science.

They refuse to update their theories when they don't reflect reality.

Instead, they alter the data with ""market corrections"".

You know what happens to scientists who do this ?

They get discredited.  Because it's not science, it's lies.

That being said, I was disappointed in the Nobel committee."
18700,"Yes, there is. I think a solution is a specialist help, that is focused on LGBT community. I would argue that's not unfair. There are specialist help for all kinds of groups that need help. And this doesn't exclude hostels for example. It's probably dumb to compare gay to alcoholic for example, but this is what came first to me. And they have special groups, places where they go, because there are less stress factors in those places. They are not just for them, but are made for them."

18737,"**Episode 35 (first timer)**

* While Nana wonders about Yasu, he is busy with another woman coming to him crying.
* Ren seems to be the only member of Trapnest who is not scared of Takumi.
* That is a very interesting conversation between Ren and Takumi. Ren suggesting that Takumi should just string Reira along, or even marry *her* instead of Hachi is rather evil, but then, he is basically reflecting Takumi’s teachings back to him. Takumi gives as good as he takes, though. Him suggesting that Ren sold out hits too close to the truth for comfort.
* If Takumi planned that outcome by sending Mari, he is a clever bastard. At least that deflects some (but certainly not all) of the anger that Reira should be feeling about Yasu.
* Nobu with the common sense reaction, sending Nana to a doctor and with more common sense when telling Nana about her running off.
* Editor with an understandable, but unlucky decision: sending his reporter away just when shit hits the fan.

I am a fan of this episode. After the big impact of the reveal, people start talking it over and forming their opinions. Maybe trying to repair it, maybe trying to live with a new situation. Although we are a far way off from any stable equilibrium.

This episode is not the first I have noticed it, but it is another example of the series doing something clever: Having in-universe characters confirm what was strongly alluded to in an earlier episode. It is a simple way to bring viewers who might have missed it, or missed the episode, up to speed.

18747,"&gt;""For the past five years, Gower has been a prosthetics designer and supervisor on Game of Thrones, where he has outfitted the Army of the Dead, designed the mysterious Night King, and made the affecting Children of the Forest a reality. It’s a job that grew increasingly essential to the show’s storylines — particularly for the final season of the HBO series, which is expected to display the long-awaited battle between the living and the dead.

&gt;Back when he first joined the HBO series in 2014, Gower’s work focused on just six White Walkers. But in the show’s last few seasons, he managed a team of about 70 to 80 people on set, spending weeks crafting prosthetics for characters and working more than 15 hours a day to apply prosthetics, remove them, and stand by for any necessary fixes on set.""

We just had a big stink about ""foreign election meddling"" yet no one ever brings up the nation that is the absolute king of election meddling in the united states.

So you're telling me that 7 months before Seth Rich died, they somehow knew he would leak info, so they preemptively coopted his reddit and set it all up to look like PR, rather than just... I dunno... stop him from leaking information in the first place?

18766,"Varying levels of involvement. Had a 24 year old who tried a CBD vape his friend brought him from California and ended up on a ventilator.

We’ve had burns come in when the battery explodes in their pocket but I didn’t include those because they don’t involve me unless their lungs are involved. Look I’m glad you know what you’re doing and it’s fine you have no issues, but unfortunately people are dying and it’s because they trust a product with a brand name on it or because their friend gave it to them and people on the internet keep perpetuating this false reality that it’s safe and nothing to worry about."

1. Measure the distance in metres and then say it's yards. This is almost certainly the case if the distance is a nice round multiple of 50, so anything that says ""200 yds"" is almost certainly 200 metres.

2. Measure the distance in metres, and then add 10% so that the sign is correct in yards. When you start to see strange numbers like ""220 yds"" or ""330 yds"" then they obviously mean 200 or 300 metres.

My local area mixes both of those, but at least we have fake metres on our signs. In the US almost all shorter distances are given in feet and it is utterly baffling: ""RIGHT LANE ENDS 1700 FEET"" and you're like 'what the fuck does that mean?'"

I'm also a big believer in heuristics, that is to say, reliance on a rule of thumb or trend in a group absent data on a specific case.  

For example, I go by the heuristic that a snake with a diamond head is venomous, but round heads are OK.  There are exceptions to this, but unless I know about a specific snake, the rule of thumb is better than no information at all.  

Similarly, I notice trends among different ethnicities.  Obviously, each individual case is different, but absent actual knowledge about that specific individual, the trend is useful for informing my decisions."

Not saying that makes them look any better, if anything it makes them look worse but there's an actual fiscal reason behind it. What I can understand is why they're worried about recouping chump change from a guy who was probably going to be benched either way? Right or wrong the best thing to do here would've been to cut him and move on, we weren't resigning him next year either way. He could get his surgery and the Jets look good for giving him time to work on getting a contract elsewhere next year. Instead we get the exact opposite.

You know the protagonist will reach his goal in the standard “get stronger to overcome any obstacle, sacrifice something along the way” fashion, it’s the journey that’s rewarding. “Let’s see what the author pictured in his head.” If you’re not into that, no point spending time on something you don’t enjoy, just drop the show, no one whose opinion matters will judge."

&gt; Rick James (born James Ambrose Johnson, Jr; February 1, 1948 - August 6, 2004) was an American funk and soul musician from Buffalo New York, who worked as a singer, keyboardist, bassist, record producer, arranger, and composer during his long career. One of the most popular artists on the Motown label during the late 1970s and early 1980s, James was famous for his wild brand of funk music and his trademark cornrow braids. As time went on, James was given the unofficial title The King of Punk-Funk.

&gt; After dropping out of high school and joining the US Naval Reserve, he eventually went AWOL to concentrate on music. He fled to Canada in 1964 and started using the name Ricky Matthews. In Toronto, he led various incarnations of mynah birds, some of which included Neil Young and Bruce Palmer (who would go on to form buffalo springfield) and Nick St. Nicholas (later of steppenwolf). After scoring a deal with Motown, the band was swindled by their manager and the label discovered James was on the lam, and the band split up.

&gt; After serving time for desertion, James tried to rekindle the Mynah Birds, but eventually found a role as a writer and producer at Motown, using the name Terry Johnson on tunes for Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles, Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers and The Spinners. He moved to California in 1969 and formed Salt 'n' Pepper (not to be confused with Salt-N-Pepa) and worked with a number of bands (Heaven and Earth, Great White Cane, and Stone City Band) before returning to Motown, where he developed the gritty funk sound that would bring him hits and notoriety. ""Super Freak"" in 1981, from the Street Songs album, was his biggest hit. During this period, he also helped launch the careers of R&amp;B singer Teena Marie and the Mary Jane Girls as well as producing Eddie Murphy's hit, Party All the Time.

&gt; After remaining moderately successful through the 80s, his popularity waned in the 90s and he succumbed to drugs, having frequent run-ins with the law, one of which resulted in a prison term. After an unsuccessful comeback attempt in 1997 and suffering a stroke, James retired. He died in 2004 from heart failure with multiple contributing factors.

Science has a funny way of finding solutions that didn't exist yesterday. I know that probably sounds like childish wishful thinking, but I know you know that's how science works. This pessimistic, defeatist attitude doesn't really help anyone or further anything but negativity. And I like I said, I understand being negative, when you don't think there's hope.

I'm guessing he's not supposed to come back at all (given that it takes ages to get him down), and him appearing in your base to attack should be a one off thing to get you back to your base after taking the mines and lumber mill. If so, the whole thing is properly broken right now."

That's the main reason why OPEC started controlling global supply, they had to sell their oil at high prices and as little as possible.  Today with shale and oilsands it's almost an endless supply.  In 2000 peak oil was thought to be in 2010.  But now peak oil has been pushed off until 2035.... unless we find more reserves around the world.

Once peak oil is hit the industry isn't ""dying"" the supply is.  When supply decreases the price increases.  You won't see anything near a death knell for oil and gas until around 2080.  Where I will long be dead."

Race swaps are surely more offensive than making a new story with a new character? It's surely saying ""we don't know how to make stories with black characters so we're just race swapping the white ones""?


Also, then you don't have to have 2 different Ariels on all the merch. It's gonna be super confusing when parents want some Little Mermaid stuff for their kid and then, whichever one it is, their kid gets upset because they wanted the ""other Ariel"".

&amp;#x200B;

Of course you can't please everyone. If it's left in, some people say it's boring to watch. And if it's taken out, fans say it's a poor adapation. It basically shows how this style of writing adapts poorly into an anime, because it splits the fanbase so much. Not to mention a lot of people don't want to read the light novel (and a lot of readers don't want to watch the anime).

I honestly didn’t know what to do given that it was just us two and we had to sit next to each other on the next flight and play together in a tournament over the next week.

19198,"Generally, gold wins games, exp can be translated into levels and levels have innate gold value because of base stats and skill level ups

A kill from a ganking jungler is under normal conditions worth 450 gold minimum. That’s about as much worth as 4 camps or more in terms of gold value. Two kills would be worth 900 gold, and that’s worth more than your entire jungle and both scuttles combined. This is bare minimum, in reality you’re also denying the enemy laners minion gold and exp. Ganks are huge if successful, and if not, generally pressuring a lane through summoners or just straight up hp difference will help greatly. Lanes is where the money is at.

Not saying these laners are right, but it’s something I try telling every jungler when applicable, two kills is worth more than your entire jungle and scuttle combined. One kill is probably close to that value if you consider lost waves. The only reason a jungler clears camp is to be enable them to stay even or slightly behind in exp and items to be able to gank. You losing a scuttles is indeed pretty large, a like 160-200 gold difference between you and enemy jungler if you consider the loss gain, but a scuttles or even two is not going to disable you from ganking or enable him harder, you’d need like 4-6 scuttlers to make that difference, when you can get the advantage? Great, if you can’t? Literally doesn’t matter until that happens 6-7 times over when the level and gold advantage actually starts kicking in."

* Doomfist was announced on July 6th, 2017. Again, changes to Numbani (which had arguably started with Orisa's addition earlier that year) prefaced this rather than the social media teases. 
* Wrecking Ball was announced June 28th, 2018. This was after the remake of Horizon Lunar Colony, which even in its original form had some references to Hammond, but the remake added more. There was also a tease campaign of about a week prior to the announcement. 

Based on this, if this hero isn't teased and announced this week (July 8th-12th) then it'll be the latest announcement of the Summer hero since the game's release. Summer has proven to be the most variable announcement window by far (the Winter/Spring hero is always last week of Feb/first week of March, the Fall hero is at BlizzCon and doesn't normally have a teaser campaign) but that would make it even MORE variable. 

And yes, Jeff already said that we should expect scheduling to be different this time around, so this isn't surprising and I'm not trying to cast aspersions about the team by laying all this out. It's just a matter of dropping the data that the announcement is later than most people predicted, and it could turn out to be even later. There's no way to know until it drops or Blizzard says something else."

So long story short, I don't think it will. Sure, its the highest grossing movie of all time and it was a huge event. Regardless, the upcoming slate of movies is extremely packed.

i don't pay for reddit, and this is typed from a second hand phone. it used to be that the price of a product was related to the cost of production, but then we started selling stuff for way more then they are actually worth, like selling a 50€ phone for 1000€(yes apple, i'm looking at you).

and when production methods improve and products become cheaper to produce, the price does not drop accordingly, only a competitor lowering his prices in an attempt to sell more tends to do this,

the time when the price of a product made any real sense has long passed, prices are decided by what people are willing to spend, this will not increase.

i doubt prices of any products would go up because of this."

Especially because I'm certain at some point in the future they're going to remove the rep-requirements because there is no way they are dumb enough to lock playable races behind a few expansions' old content.

19372,"Which doesn't contradict what I said - that British fishermen fish in EU waters. Fish and shellfish, shock horror, covers plenty of species, working purely on tonnage is pointless as something like lobster sells for a lot more per kg than say cod.

In 2018, British fishermen landed 696318 tonnes [source](https://fishingnews.co.uk/features/summary-analysis-of-uk-landings-data-2018/) of fish worth slightly over £1bn. So the EU fishermen took 560,000 tonnes of fish from the UK EEZ worth £300m (£535.71 per tonne), yet British fishermen landed only 140000 tonnes more, but that fish was worth £1436.13 per tonne. Furthermore, the NAFC Marine centre [source](https://www.nafc.uhi.ac.uk/t4-media/one-web/nafc/research/document/eez-reports/EEZ-Report-11---2018-04-30.pdf) estimated that the UK's 2018 haul of 83000 tonnes of fish from the EU EEZ was worth £112m or £1349.40 per tonne!

Hence talking about weight of fish caught is meaningless and proving exactly what I said, correct - Brexit party are potentially going to lose fishermen over 1/10 of their income by ending mutual fishing rights."

19382,"Despite the 146M losses on the balance sheet at the 30th of June 2019, *Milan's numbers are less worrying than what they seem at a first glance*. Elliott is working on covering the losses, by guaranteeing enterprise continuity and a total economic safety in the club. Translated, Milan's close future is not only shadows, on the contrary...

The losses on the 2018/19 were largely expected, *but are already destined to shrink already from the next season and the following seasons*, gradually the club will shift towards a conformity with FFP terms. Surely it is a challenging process, but it has already started. An important reason to see a spiral of light at the end of the tunnel, but certainly not the only one.

By focusing exclusively on the liability part of the 2018/19 balance sheet, one is at risk of moving away from the real panoramic situation of the club: it cannot go under the radar than, in parallel with the losses, there is also the clear improvement of the equity structure, which has grown by *119M (from -36M in June 2018, +83M one year later)*: an extremely significant index of the financial health of AC Milan and a sign of the tangible efforts of Elliott towards the club since day one.

Fans will be worried by the mercato, a chapter that has always heated the hearts of the Rossoneri. From what we obtained, Milan - who invested a lot and paid with the exclusion from the Europa League - is not obliged by the accounts to sell its key players in January. No sale is in place for the winter mercato, speech that can be postponed until summer, as Elliott’s will is to fix the accounts ASAP.

*It is also clear that the eventual qualification of Milan in the Champions League would change the scenarios, as it would bring new TV revenue, sponsors, merchandising and stadium. This is why, contrary to the popular belief that we cannot exclude Milan making moves on the winter market to further improve the squad in order to get that top 4 spot which could mean a lot for the present and the future of the club.*"

I mean...sometimes you do. Champions of Light dropped BiS or close to it for BoD for many classes

But anyways that isn't the point. In a raid you know what is on the loot table. You know what bosses you need to kill and then it's just a matter of hoping for the drop from boss, or using a coin, or get a trade from a teammate. Oscillators are far more rare since they are soulbound and only have ONE guaranteed way of getting them


&gt; God forbid people have to dedicate time to get something actually good. Combined with the fact you get more than 1 a day if you actually care to put in the effort and people are just bitching for the sake of bitching.

It's not the fact it takes time. It's the fact it's wildly disproportionate with the time required to get other t3 essences. Combined with the fact you are talking out of your ass regarding the more than 1 per day ""if you actually care"". Rare mobs and chests are NOT guaranteed to drop them. Realistically you have 1 guaranteed per day - that's it. Which is absurd since they are used to craft/buy so much in Mechagon.

https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/identitaere-125.html

&gt;tagesschau24: Previously, the ""Identitarian Movement"" was listed as a suspicious case, now it is regarded as ""secured right-wing extremist"". How do you explain this reassessment?

&gt;Andreas Speit: In recent years, the entire right-wing extremist scene has become enormously radicalized - including the ""Identitarian Movement"". They are of the opinion that a great exchange would take place in Europe and that this would mean that the very own population would be exchanged. Now they see a biological boundary crossed and have this enormous pressure to act.

&gt;tagesschau24: The movement is neither raw nor violent. What is radical about the ""identitaries""?

&gt;Speit: Their strategy of trying to gain a foothold in the middle of society is radical. They want to move the masses, but not become a mass movement. Verbally they have indeed become more and more radical. And there have already been violent conflicts with ""identitarians"", they have already attacked people in the Federal Republic.
 tagesschau24: What are the typical arguments of the movement?

&gt;Speit: The typical argument is that every ethnic group has its ancestral habitat. We know this from the so-called New Right, it sounds a bit like it is not racist, but if you look at how these ethnic groups are defined, it becomes clear that in the end it is the old ""blood and soil"" ideology. It is only propagated in a more modern way, presented more populist and also more actionist.

&gt;tagesschau24: Can you describe why ""identitaries"" initially seem harmless to many?

&gt;Speit: It comes as a bit of a surprise that there are rights who can also talk and do the actions that are more familiar from the alternative left milieu. The identitaries that have existed in Germany since 2012 benefit from the fact that we still have the image of the right-wing extremist with a bald head, a bomber jacket and Springer boots in our heads. They have let themselves be blinded a little.

&gt;tagesschau24: Is this model ""people = race"", as it used to be called, thought through to the end with the identities? And how is that supposed to work?

&gt;Speit: In the end, they want a homogenous society. Leading cadres of the ""identitarians"" repeatedly emphasize that people who were born here but have parents with a migration background can never become Germans. They seriously demand re-migration without saying exactly how they imagine it. Even guest workers who helped to develop the economic miracle in Germany are actually troublemakers for them who have no business here.

&gt;tagesschau24: Are there any connections between the ""identitarians"" and the AfD?

&gt;Speit: The position of repatriation is also a position within the AfD. Björn Höcke even goes a step further and says that even with people who are in favour of immigration, one should actually consider whether they should stay in Germany. We know, for example, that there are relations to the ""Identitarian Movement"" in the scientific staff of the Bundestag. They have also existed at Landtag level.

 &gt;tagesschau24: How and where do the ""identitaries"" act?

&gt;Speit: They try to place their position in the middle of society. They succeeded in doing so in 2016 with the short occupation of the Brandenburg Gate. That was what they wanted: It was reported live. Such actions take place again and again on a smaller scale. The difference, however, is that the media no longer play along as they did in the beginning. Many journalists have realized that if they don't pay attention, they will become PR advisors to the movement.

&gt;tagesschau24: The movement isn't really that big. What significance does the group have in establishing right-wing ideas?

&gt;Speit: The number should not be underestimated: There are 600 convinced cadres. We know from internal documents that not everyone is welcome there either, that there are entrance examinations, so to speak. They are mainly present on the street through actions and on social networks such as YouTube and Twitter. There, for example, one of the leading managers has more than 100,000 followers.

&gt;tagesschau24: What consequences will the re-evaluation by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution have for the ""identitarians""?

&gt;Speit: Above all, the AfD will probably distance itself more because it is afraid that it will then be observed more and more. There will be new friction.

&gt;tagesschau24: Do you think it makes sense to ban this movement?

&gt;Speit: The name and the logo would disappear. But I think that this movement has the goal of keeping itself more in the discourse through actions. It can be assumed that the cadres will then continue to be politically active elsewhere. Some of them are already involved in other projects, such as writing for right-wing newspapers."

The week before they had the spy.

19687,"Because its quite possible that the LGBT youths would be heckled or even abused by some of the non-LGBT youths in those centres. And by specifically creating LGBT or LGBT friendly centres, it makes it more likely that the abused LGBT teenagers will seek out those shelters as they will then know the odds of getting more abuse from fellow residents is low."

19689,Or possibly edit out plankton fun song and put in another more appropriate song
19690,"I get it. I just think he is probably pretty raw and drained right now. If fans are sad about the end of GOT, imagine how the cast and crew must feel. It's got to be much more emotional for them. 

Many cast and crew members have expressed a sense of loss and sadness. Combine that sadness with the burden associated with intense attention from fans, and that's a LOT to carry. 

Giving a person space, time, and privacy is thoughtful and kind. You are doing something for him by giving him a break.

I'm glad that the show (and probably the comaradarie here too) was meaningful to you.

I will miss the show and the fun we've had discussing it.

In this case when the distance between 2 countries is less than 6nmi the waters are split in the middle. So in between Μεγίστη and your land the waters will be always the same no matter what Greek territorial waters will be like.

If Greece's territorial waters are 12nmi on the other hand Turkish navy won't be able to play at war between Thessaloniki and my Island."
19694,"&gt; Is it an error? If yes, that’s clear and obvious.

No, it isn't. There's a bit of a middle ground where subjectivity comes in, such as, for example, whether there is enough contact to illicit a foul. So I don't think your logic holds up."
19695,"there was a lot of controversy about Neeko being gay.

I think best case the young guys make another leap, Kyrie doesn't fuck with the chemistry, and they're a top seed, make the conference finals.  

I don't think people would be wildly surprised if anyone in the Sixers/Bucks/Nets/Celtics came out of the East, but I don't think anyone but the 76ers and Bucks could compete against western teams."

19724,Are you using a keyboard and mouse?
19725,"You are quite wrong going by this logic sadly.  
You are saying because they were on the side of the axis it is more likely to still have believers. I am from germany, i received a very lengthy and detailed education on everything that germany has done since 1871. It took over 4 years and 2 of them were spend on understanding what exactly happened during WW1 and WW2 (especially the later). In germany this is mandatory education. Germany still has a few believers of hitler´s ideas but most educated people understand the attrocities and judge them accordingly.  

What i am trying to say is that its not because they were once part of the axis that they still have many but rather that they do not educate about the issues with hitlers ideas including the facts about his bullshit regime. Germany takes this very serious, in fact germany has fundamental laws that prevent lots of these things, its impossible for germany to start another war too. (Thats also because the allies had quite some demands)  

Anyway, japan denied educating their generations about their and germanys attrocities commited during ww2 and therefore still has many who sympathise with hitler´s ideas."

19730,"I mean Geoffrey didnt earn his throne it was given to him. Cersei didnt earn the throne it was just a blood and parentage thing. Lots of people make the best of their situation be it last name or family ties and she did the same. Fits with the times. That's also probably why she repeats her titles all the time. ""Daenerys Stormborn of house Targaryen. You've probably heard of my family so..."" of course a slave is gonna follow the pretty lady with confidence and titles and once an army of slaves does it, she has power."
19731,That’s a really annoying loss because it was so winnable and they couldn’t close. The rotation late made little sense to me at all.
19732,"I did! 

It's actually amazing to watch different documentaries produced on the case. I follow it closely, and one thing that the JonBenet Ramsey case is famous for is these documentaries not really presenting the facts unbiased, but rather going in and trying to present the facts in a way that makes you, the viewer, draw a conclusion at the end. 

To listen to John Ramsey today and to hear him talk about this is pretty wild. I mean, from the outside looking in it seems like he's just a sweet old man who's still searching for answers. His ex-wife, Patsy, died of cancer years ago and she claimed innocence right to her grave. Burke, his son, has taken several lie detector tests and passed all of them...again, who knows. 

It's really the perfect storm. If it was someone unknown to them, that person got EXTREMELY lucky that everything went wrong after the fact, and they got away with it. If it was the Ramsey's themselves, then they got extremely lucky."
19733,"Dudley looks like he belongs in my rec league, not the NBA"
19734,"Its not intuitive at all.  A player got half the win shares in one game, in a loss, that another player had all year with dozens of wins.  It shares the name of a different system, in a different sport, that works completely different.

It makes no sense.  You have to actually look at the formulas themselves to have any clue what it is measuring."
19735,"Yea but the argument goes were in chicken and the egg territory.

  
If we pull troops out then that doesn't mean every ""terrorist"" will go away and even if 90% of them are satisfied with withdrawal that 10% will now be gunning for the mainland and us civilians. 

So they're going with the option that feeds the military industrial complex and allows them to have the perpetual war which allows them to invoke all sorts of chicanery that wouldn't be allowed in ""peace time"""

How do people still dont catch on to the fact that CS is a team not about kills, but about getting bomb to explode or not."
19740,"I watched a documentary on Netflix. My reason for watching was maybe it would shed some light on why some people choose to reject science. They can't be all idiots and I believe this trend with people believing that opinions are more important than facts is the greatest threat to modern democracies. Because these people vote.  I am Italian and that's exactly how Berlusconi stayed in power nearly uninterruptedly for almost two decades. Then I found out about flat-earthers and anti-vaxxers. And then Brexit and Trump happened. I think it's all part of the same problem. What I mean is: I don't mind if you make choices that I would never ever make, as long as they're INFORMED choices."
19741,You honestly think DC fans are going to disagree with that? We all want Snyder to sell the team.

19767,They’re leaving a guaranteed decade-long job &amp; leaving behind cast &amp; crew that they’ve worked with in a steady routine for that decade. For the younger cast members it’s a huge deal because they’re more or less entering the unknown now.

19778,"I fully agree, but the thing is having lots of money **allows** you to give those animators all the time they need and maybe hire more experienced and well known/talented ones. Of course if you had bad scheduling from the start money's not gonna save you. But if for example a production commitee decides to give a studio much time to animate a show, that also means that they take into account that they get the money at a later point in time, money that, had they acquired it earlier they could use to invest in different stuff again.

When you consider across a post claiming something without a source, just doing a web search for the terms in their claim usually will get you more reading on the subject.

19822,"&gt; История про Дугина.
&gt; 
&gt; Рассказывает Егор Летов: 
&gt; 
&gt; Жили мы как-то у Курехина - Дугин, я и Нюрыч. Мы просыпаемся, я открываю форточку, Дугин задумчиво лежит на кровати, спрашивает: ""А вот где у нас Омск находится?"" Я говорю: ""Ну, где: на югах Сибири. Рядом с Казахстаном"". - ""Казахстан рядом у вас? А что если казахи ветер отравили? Они же могут ветер отравить! Ну-ка, срочно форточку закрой: ветер отравленный!"" Причем, на полном серьезе: испугался страшно, начал по комнате ходить. ""Казахи, блин, ветер отравили - как же я пойду? Так оно и есть, точно. Я знаю, у них есть камышовые люди. У них есть озеро Балхаш, и там в больших количествах растет тростник, камыш. И там живут тростниковые, камышовые люди, которые никогда не высовываются, только через трубочку дышат"". Потом еще подумал, подумал и говорит: ""А посередине Балхаша есть огромный остров, где живет гигантский, исполинский кот, которому все они поклоняются"". Это курехинские дела, однозначно. Откуда ему еще такое взять? Говорит: ""Блин, камыш! Камышовые люди кругом, что же делать? Они же нашествие могут устроить! Это ведь все - нам тогда конец! Если камышовые люди вылезут - и на нас полезут со своим котом! А кот огромный, три метра ростом!"""
19823,"Alternatively, for interactions, she could play simplified string versions of champions' themes.

Example: You load in as Camille jungle, amd you run to your buff. Following you is your Sona, and as you run you hear Sona playing the violins of Camille's theme on her Etwahl (not the actual theme, just a cover, like how Silent Night plays Deck the Halls)

Adds interactions, keeps her mute, and expands on the fantasy of her being a world-renowned musician. Hell, they could do it *now* if they really wanted since it doesn't require a voice actor"

19832,"**First-time viewer (sub).**

First contact between two members of the trio! Both Shoukei and Suzu already encountered people that knew Youko but they were always so far apart. Wouldn't Suzu's journey by ship take a while though? Not entirely sure of the scale of the world so I figured a good amount of time would have passed.

At 1200 years, Ryuu-ou's the longest reigning monarch I've heard of yet. But as has been mentioned before, that stability isn't always a good thing as we see how brazenly corrupt the court system is. Complacency can lead to a slow decline.

Suzu wasn't smart to leave the blind kid with the guy who couldn't speak the language but I'm not sure there's much else she could have done considering Asano again flipped out the moment she walked away. I didn't expect Seishuu to just *die* like that but I guess he wasn't long for this world after becoming blind anyway.

Oh, and Asano's about to assassinate a nobleman which I'm sure will lead to headaches. If it's even possible with a gun, that is, since Sen-nin seem to have some level of immunity to basic weapons going by the uproar over the cache revealed as part of the conspiracy. Or maybe the guy wasn't actually a Sen-nin and was just trying to use his title or some other connection (he said ""Shoukou"" right? I don't remember what that means, if anything) to intimidate someone who can't even understand him.

Aside from that there's also a bear Hanjyuu which, first of all, *cool*. He's also part of some organization that sounds a bit shady at the moment, maybe some rebels? Either way he can also speak Japanese so is presumably a Sen-nin, interesting."

It's going about the same story as S in a very different way and that itself is interesting enough but the general presentation is so much better than the previous Cystal seasons, even if it seems like they've gone back to '90s style stock footage attacks (I had the biggest grin when I heard that sound effect for Burning Mandala). There's still some issues, from general weirdness like the girls being able to hear and identify judo noises from what seemed like multiple kilometers of distance to [how](/s ""the Witches 5 are already being dispatched without really doing much of note, although this doesn't bother me as much as with the previous seasons since they weren't all that much better in S "").

&amp;#x200B;

He absolutely crushed our team single-handily (2000 SR +/-), and we ended up getting matched against him two games in a row.

""Because I like to stomp on lowbies"" was the response I got back.

Reported, but nothing from it materialized; at least not that I'm aware of.

&amp;#x200B;

What I took from it -

He plateaued, and instead of putting in his own time and effort to improve and keep climbing, he decides to throw down to bronze and wreak havoc, just because he can. In a way, I feel sorry for him.

The lady behind the counter, who I had never seen before, was like uhhh what, it just comes with the meat that it comes with. And I was like yeah of course, I just want double the meat, and I'll pay for the meat. She scoffed and said nope, it's just what it comes with. This went back and forth for a while.

Then I said, ok, I will order a single meat with the sides, then ANOTHER whole platter, but on the second platter, I don't want the sides, JUST the meat (yes I know I am crazy, I'm better now.) And she said NOPE. You get one platter. That's it.

His story : fall and get handicapped, get north by being carried or dragged, become wikipedia, come back and bait NK.

Tyrion speaks of stories of the king that would make him a legend so that the people would accept him.

&amp;#x200B;

He hardly  has a better story than any other character in the serie.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really easy inventing a story, the winner always write the history HE wants people to retain. So you don't really need anyone with a good story, just anyone whom everyone would agree not to tell the real truth.

&amp;#x200B;

The only true advantage of making him king is that vicious people like LittleFinger would not be able to get far with Wikipedia looking at his past. Only honnest people will get to seats of power. That would have been the way to push him on the throne.

&amp;#x200B;

And to be honnest, the wheel has not been broken. When he dies, of there is any powerfull House Ruler that's want's the throne, he just has to buy half of the voter with fear/money/power etc and he will be king, and just has to overrule that voting system and even make a war if has to."
19966,"There's a mix of takes here, most of which aren't quite right.

&amp;nbsp;

**Main tanks** are defined by the role they play for their team: they create the space for their team to work by applying pressure to the enemy's positions. Main tanks are subdivided by *how* they create that space - *anchor tanks* provide a focal point for their team to rally behind as they pressure the enemy front line (**Orisa, Reinhardt**), whereas *dive tanks* (**Winston, Wrecking Ball**) are designed to bypass the enemy's front line and physically disrupt their positioning.

**Off-tanks**, meanwhile, are focused on securing the space that the main tanks open up, and acting as bodyguards for their team. D.Va, Roadhog, and Zarya are all off-tanks.

&amp;nbsp;

The division between main/off-healer is defined by a combination of healing throughput and utility. **Main healers** have higher heals-per-second potential, but offer comparatively little utility to their team in terms of defensive ultimates or buffs / debuffs. Your main healers are **Ana, Baptiste, Mercy,** and **Moira**. (Off-healers are Brigitte, Lucio, and Zenyatta.)"
